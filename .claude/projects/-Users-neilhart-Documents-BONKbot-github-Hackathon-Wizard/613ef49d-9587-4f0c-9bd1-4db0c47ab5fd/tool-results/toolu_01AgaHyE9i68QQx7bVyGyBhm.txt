     3→> Configurable analysis rules that trigger automated trades via LOIS - with paper trading to prove it works.
     4→
     5→## Why This Matters
     6→
     7→Users want to automate trading decisions but the "complex logic" for analysis has always been seen as too hard to build. This proves that with Claude-assisted development, you can ship a configurable analysis engine in days, not months. Plus, paper trading shows users exactly what they would have made - proof of value, not just promises.

     9→## The Demo Moment
    10→
    11→Live demo showing:
    12→1. User configures analysis rules (price patterns, momentum triggers)
    13→2. Rules fire against real market data
    14→3. Mock LOIS trade signals execute
    15→4. **Paper trading P&L updates in real-time: "Your rules made +$X"**
    16→
    17→The "holy shit" is not the analysis - it's the **tracked performance proving the analysis works**.
    18→
    19→## What I'll Learn
    20→
    21→- Claude Code workflow (full development cycle, not just prompting)
    22→- Building configurable rule engines
    23→- Integrating with existing systems (LOIS mock)
    24→

    27→## Build Plan
    28→
    29→### Day 1: Foundation + AI Proof
    30→
    31→**Goal:** Claude responding to token data / analysis logic generation
    32→
    33→- [ ] Set up dev environment with Claude Code
    34→- [ ] Connect to trading terminal API (data source)
    35→- [ ] Build first analysis template with Claude's help (price pattern detection)
    36→- [ ] Test: given token data, does analysis run correctly?
    37→
    38→**EOD Check:** Can run a basic price pattern analysis on a token and get results
    39→
    40→### Day 2: Core Features + LOIS Integration
    41→
    42→**Goal:** Analysis rules trigger mock trades + tracking works
    43→
    44→- [ ] Build momentum/volume analysis template
    45→- [ ] Create user configuration interface (ugly but functional)
    46→- [ ] Implement mock LOIS trigger when criteria met
    47→- [ ] Add paper trading P&L tracking
    48→- [ ] Test: full loop from config -> analysis -> trigger -> P&L update
    49→
    50→**EOD Check:** Can configure a rule, have it fire, see mock trade and P&L
    51→
    52→**Decision Point:** If behind, activate Failsafe
    53→
    54→### Day 3: Polish + Demo Prep
    55→
    56→**Goal:** Demo-ready by EOD
    57→
    58→- [ ] Polish critical path (happy path must be smooth)
    59→- [ ] Pre-configure compelling demo rules
    60→- [ ] Seed paper trading with impressive P&L history
    61→- [ ] Practice demo flow end-to-end
    62→- [ ] Handle demo edge cases (what if API slow? what if no triggers?)
    63→
    64→**Demo Day:**
    65→
    66→- [ ] Final test run
    67→- [ ] Backup: screenshots/recording if live fails
    68→- [ ] Prepare "here's the P&L this week" narrative
    69→

    72→## Resources
    73→
    74→**Tools:** Claude Code (primary)
    75→
    76→**APIs:**
    77→- Trading terminal API (data source)
    78→- LOIS API (mock for demo, real for production)
    79→
    80→**Help:**
    81→- Terminal team: API questions
    82→- LOIS team: Integration patterns
    83→
    84→---
    85→
    86→## Failsafe Plan
    87→
    88→**Trigger:** End of Day 2 significantly behind
    89→
    90→**Fallback:** Analysis rules + notification only (no LOIS trigger, no P&L tracking)
    91→
    92→**Cut:**
    93→- Paper trading performance tracking
    94→- LOIS integration
    95→- Multiple analysis types (just do one well)
    96→
    97→**Keep:**
    98→- Configurable analysis rules
    99→- Real data, real analysis
   100→- Demo that one rule works
   101→
   102→---
   103→
   104→## Wild Cards (Future Ideas)
   105→
   106→- **User Intent Dashboard** - the other spark about understanding what users are trying to do
   107→- Full production LOIS integration (real trades)
   108→- Analysis marketplace (share rules)
   109→- Backtesting against historical data
   110→- AI-suggested rules based on user trading history
   111→
   112→---
   113→
   114→## Tech Notes
   115→
   116→**Architecture:**
   117→```
   118→User Config -> Analysis Engine (code, not AI) -> Trigger System -> Mock LOIS
   119→                     |
   120→                     v
   121→            Paper Trading Tracker -> P&L Dashboard
   122→```
   123→
   124→**Key Decisions:**
   125→- Claude helps BUILD analysis logic, doesn't RUN analysis at query time
   126→- Deterministic code execution = fast, reliable, no hallucination risk
   127→- Mock LOIS for demo = safe, clear path to production
