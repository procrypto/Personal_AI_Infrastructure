   380→## Williams Fractal Trailing Stop (TSL)
   381→
   382→Trails stop loss to the SECOND most recent VALID fractal low, giving trades room to breathe while protecting profits.
   383→
   384→### Why Second Most Recent Valid?
   385→
   386→1. **Most recent fractal** might be too close (normal pullback could stop out)
   387→2. **Valid only** - fractals invalidated by subsequent lower lows are discarded
   388→3. **Second-to-last** represents more significant support that actually held
   389→
   390→### Fractal Detection
   391→
   392→A Williams fractal low is a bar where the low is the lowest of surrounding bars:
   393→
   394→```
   395→With 3/3 settings (7-bar window):
   396→  Bar:  1    2    3   [4]   5    6    7
   397→  Low: 1.05 1.03 1.02 1.00 1.01 1.03 1.04
   398→                      ↑ Lowest of all 7 bars = fractal low
   399→```
   400→
   401→Fractal is confirmed 3 bars after it occurs (rightBars delay).
   402→
   403→### Valid Fractal Filtering
   404→
   405→A fractal low is **invalid** if followed by a LOWER fractal low (support was broken):
   406→
   407→```
   408→Fractal lows: $1.00 → $1.02 → $1.05 → $1.03
   409→                                ↑
   410→                         $1.03 < $1.05, so $1.05 is invalidated
   411→
   412→Valid lows: $1.00 → $1.02 → $1.03
   413→Second most recent = $1.02
   414→Trail stop = $1.02
   415→```
   416→
   417→### Configuration
   418→
   419→```typescript
   420→{
   421→  enabled: true,
   422→  leftBars: 3,              // Bars to left of fractal
   423→  rightBars: 3,             // Bars to right (confirmation delay)
   424→  triggerBufferPercent: 0.1 // 0.1% buffer below stop
   425→}
   426→```
   427→
   428→### How It Works
   429→
   430→1. Fetch 1m candles for open positions (last 50 bars)
   431→2. Detect all Williams fractal lows
   432→3. Filter to valid fractals only (not invalidated by lower lows)
   433→4. Trail stop to second most recent valid fractal
   434→5. Stop only moves UP, never down
   435→6. Exit when price closes below trailing stop
