The file /Users/neilhart/Documents/BONKbot/github/token-analysis-autopilot/README.md has been updated. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of the edited file:
   166→### Output Sections
   167→- **Scan**: Tokens being analyzed with signals (- = hold, BUY/SELL = signal with confidence)
   168→- **Trades**: Open positions with size and unrealized P&L (green = profit, red = loss)
   169→
   170→## Auto-Sources
   171→
   172→Auto-sources provide automated token screening by pulling from BONKbot's discovery endpoints:
   173→
   174→- **Trending**: Tokens with high recent volume/activity from `/discovery/trending`
   175→- **Whale Moves**: Tokens being actively traded by whale wallets from `/discovery/whale_moves`
   176→
   177→### How It Works
   178→
   179→1. On startup, auto-sources are fetched immediately
   180→2. Lists refresh every 15 minutes (configurable)
   181→3. Tokens from auto-sources are analyzed alongside your manual watchlist
   182→4. Same rule sets apply to all sources (TODO: per-source strategies)
   183→5. Source is tracked and displayed in output for transparency
   184→
   185→### Configuration
   186→
   187→```bash
   188→# Check current status
   189→npm run cli sources
   190→
   191→# Enable/disable all auto-sources
   192→npm run cli sources on
   193→npm run cli sources off
   194→
   195→# Toggle individual sources
   196→npm run cli sources trending off
   197→npm run cli sources whales on
   198→```
   199→
   200→### Notes
   201→
   202→- Auto-sources have unlimited position limits (TODO: add per-source limits)
   203→- No spam filtering currently applied (TODO: add when expanding to broader sources)
   204→- Manual watchlist tokens always take priority over auto-source duplicates
   205→
   206→## Opposite Signal Handling
   207→
   208→Configure behavior when opposite signal fires on an open position:
   209→
   210→```typescript
   211→onOppositeSignal: 'close' | 'flip' | 'ignore'
   212→```
