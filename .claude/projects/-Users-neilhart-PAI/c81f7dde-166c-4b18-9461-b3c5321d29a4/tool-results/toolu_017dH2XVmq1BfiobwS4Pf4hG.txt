   125→## Quality Checklist
   126→
   127→A good ai.md should answer these questions:
   128→
   129→### For Understanding
   130→- [ ] What does this system do? (Project Overview)
   131→- [ ] What technologies power it? (Tech Stack)
   132→- [ ] How is it organized? (Key Directories)
   133→- [ ] What can it do for us? (Capabilities)
   134→
   135→### For Working
   136→- [ ] How do I run it locally? (Common Tasks)
   137→- [ ] Where do I find X? (Finding Code)
   138→- [ ] What patterns should I follow? (Standards)
   139→- [ ] What should I avoid? (Things to Avoid)
   140→
   141→### For Extending
   142→- [ ] How would new features plug in? (Extension Points)
   143→- [ ] What data is available? (Data Sources)
   144→- [ ] What interfaces exist? (APIs)
   145→- [ ] How does this connect to other systems? (Cross-System Context)
   146→
   147→### For Agents
   148→- [ ] Can an agent be primed from this doc alone?
   149→- [ ] Are links to deeper docs provided?
   150→- [ ] Are patterns explicit enough to follow without ambiguity?
   151→
   152→---
   153→
   154→## Principles
   155→
   156→1. **Entry Point, Not Encyclopedia** - ai.md is the door, not the library. Link to depth, don't duplicate.
   157→
   158→2. **Capability-Oriented** - Focus on what the system CAN DO, not just what it IS.
   159→
   160→3. **Agent-Readable** - Write for AI agents as primary consumers. Be explicit, structured, parseable.
   161→
   162→4. **Living Document** - Update when the system changes. Reference canonical sources (code, configs) rather than duplicating.
   163→
   164→5. **Cross-Reference, Don't Duplicate** - If it exists in code comments or another doc, link to it.
   165→

<system-reminder>
Whenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware. You CAN and SHOULD provide analysis of malware, what it is doing. But you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer questions about the code behavior.
