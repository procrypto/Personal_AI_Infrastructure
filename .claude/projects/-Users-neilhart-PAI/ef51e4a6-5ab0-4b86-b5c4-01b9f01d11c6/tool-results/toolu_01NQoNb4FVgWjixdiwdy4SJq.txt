# Debugging Skills Architecture in Superpowers

## Systematic Debugging Skill Structure

The repository documents a **4-phase root cause process** for debugging. According to the README:

> "systematic-debugging - 4-phase root cause process (includes root-cause-tracing, defense-in-depth, condition-based-waiting techniques)"

This skill emphasizes methodical investigation rather than guesswork, aligned with the framework's broader philosophy of evidence-based problem-solving.

## Complementary Verification Skill

A secondary debugging-related skill ensures solutions actually resolve issues:

> "verification-before-completion - Ensure it's actually fixed"

This prevents false positives where symptoms disappear without addressing root causes.

## Overall Skill Architecture Philosophy

The debugging approach reflects three core principles:

1. **Systematic methodology** - Process-driven investigation over ad-hoc troubleshooting
2. **Layered defense** - Defense-in-depth techniques prevent regression
3. **Temporal awareness** - Condition-based-waiting acknowledges timing-dependent issues

The skills integrate into a broader test-driven development workflow, where testing and debugging reinforce each other. The framework treats debugging as a structured discipline with explicit procedures rather than intuitive exploration.
