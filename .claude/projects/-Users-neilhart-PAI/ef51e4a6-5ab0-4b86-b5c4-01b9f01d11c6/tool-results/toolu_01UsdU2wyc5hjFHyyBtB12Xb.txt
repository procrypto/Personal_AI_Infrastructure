Based on the content provided, there are **no dedicated debug-specific skills** listed in this awesome-claude-skills repository.

However, the repository does reference debugging-adjacent capabilities:

## Related Debugging Approaches

**Superpowers Library**: The [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) collection mentions including "debugging" among its "20+ battle-tested skills." The exact implementation details for these debugging skills aren't specified in the documentation.

**Testing Capability**: The [webapp-testing](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/webapp-testing) skill supports "UI verification and debugging" through Playwright automation, enabling verification of local web application behavior.

## Key Insight

The repository emphasizes that Skills function as "reusable procedural knowledge" rather than isolated tools. Debugging capabilities appear integrated into broader skill libraries (like superpowers) rather than published as standalone debug skills. The repository encourages contributors to submit new skills, suggesting debug-focused skills could be community contributions rather than official Anthropic releases at this time.
