Here are the key findings on Claude Code debugging skills and best practices for 2025:

## Claude Code Debugging Best Practices

### Official Debugging Tools
Run debug mode using `claude --debug` to see Skill loading errors.(no content)When working with MCP, you can also launch Claude with the `--mcp-debug` flag to help identify configuration issues.

### Core Debugging Approach
Claude Code excels at debugging because it reads your entire codebase and traces execution paths across files. It spots subtle bugs and identifies root causes across multiple components. For complex or sensitive bugs, use Plan Mode first.

### Systematic Debugging Skill
When debugging with discipline using the systematic-debugging skill, Claude enforces a four-step process: Root Cause Investigation (trace the issue back to its origin), form hypotheses, apply fixes, and document.(no content)Claude's Systematic Debugging skill approaches issues methodically. You can provide error logs and Claude analyzes stack traces in languages like Python or Java.

### Debugging Workflows
For Runtime Errors, ask Claude to analyze specific files and identify where undefined values originate, often revealing prop, state, or async data loading issues. For Logic Bugs, Claude traces through functions step-by-step with sample data, spotting mathematical errors, edge cases, or incorrect data structure assumptions.(no content)Plan Mode enables safe error analysis without risking accidental fixes to working code. Claude traces execution paths across multiple files to identify root causes beyond symptoms.

### Creating Reusable Debug Commands
For repeated workflows—debugging loops, log analysis, etc.—store prompt templates in Markdown files within the `.claude/commands` folder. These become available through the slash commands menu when you type `/`. You can check these commands into git to make them available for the rest of your team.

### Skills Architecture
Claude Skills are folders with instructions, scripts, and resources that teach Claude specific tasks. Skills can include executable code and are loaded only when needed, allowing you to maintain hundreds without performance impact.(no content)The key to writing effective skill prompts is keeping them focused and using progressive disclosure: provide core instructions in SKILL.md, and reference external files for detailed content.

### Community Resources
The obra/superpowers library provides core skills for Claude Code with 20+ battle-tested skills including TDD, debugging, and collaboration patterns. It features `/brainstorm`, `/write-plan`, `/execute-plan` commands and a skills-search tool.
