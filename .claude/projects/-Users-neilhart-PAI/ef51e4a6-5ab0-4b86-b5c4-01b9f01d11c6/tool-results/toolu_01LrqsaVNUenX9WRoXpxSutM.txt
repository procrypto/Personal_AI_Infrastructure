# Claude Code Debugging Methodology

## Core Approach

Claude Code excels at debugging by "reading your entire codebase and traces execution paths across files" to identify subtle bugs and root causes spanning multiple components.

## Key Methodology: Plan Mode

The recommended two-phase debugging approach uses Plan Mode first for "safe error analysis without risking accidental fixes to working code." Claude analyzes errors and presents a structured investigation plan before switching to execution mode.

## Error Analysis Workflow

The systematic process involves:

1. **Start with Full Context** — Provide complete error messages and stack traces so Claude interprets cryptic errors beyond symptoms
2. **Add Temporal Information** — Share when the bug started occurring (e.g., "This error started happening after I added user authentication")
3. **Supply Relevant Code** — Share the files directly and ask Claude to "trace through the execution path that leads to this error"

## Common Debugging Patterns

- **Runtime Errors**: Identify where undefined values originate in props, state, or async data loading
- **Logic Bugs**: Step-through functions with sample data to spot mathematical errors and edge cases
- **Performance Issues**: Analyze time complexity and identify bottlenecks in rendering or data fetching
- **Integration Problems**: Review authentication flows for timing issues and race conditions

## Advanced Techniques

- State flow analysis (Redux mutations across reducers)
- Cross-file investigation following dependencies
- Pattern recognition comparing similar previously-fixed bugs
- Edge case discovery through unusual input testing

## Systematic Debug Process

The recommended five-step workflow: **Reproduce** → **Isolate** → **Understand** → **Fix** → **Prevent**

## Best Practice Recommendation

"Ask Claude to explain why the bug occurred, how to prevent similar issues, and to update your CLAUDE.md with relevant guidelines or checks" to build systematic prevention into your project.
