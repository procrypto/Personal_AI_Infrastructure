Use `claude --debug` to see Skill loading errors.\n- Check dependencies are installed. If your Skill uses external packages, they must be installed in your environment before Claude can use them.\n\n### Community Debugging Skills\n\n**Systematic Debugging Skill:**\nWhen a bug appeared, Claude didn't guess. It invoked the systematic-debugging skill, which enforces a four-step process: Root Cause Investigation (trace the issue back to its origin), Pattern Analysis (see if similar issues exist elsewhere), Hypothesis Testing (form a theory and test it with evidence), and Implementation (apply the fix only after the cause is understood). This prevents the frustrating cycle of trial-and-error fixes.(no content)Systematic Debugging makes Claude debug like a senior dev. Root cause → hypotheses → fixes → documentation. No more random stabbing.\n\n**Discover-Debugging Plugin:**\nProvides automatic access to comprehensive debugging skills. This skill auto-activates when you're working with: debugging, GDB, LLDB, profiling, memory leaks, performance analysis, troubleshooting, diagnostics.\n\n### Community Skill Repositories\n\nSeveral community repositories curate Claude Code skills:\n\n1. **VoltAgent/awesome-claude-skills** - Claude Skills are folders with instructions, scripts, and resources that teach Claude specific tasks. Skills can include executable code and are loaded only when needed, allowing you to maintain hundreds without performance impact.\n\n2. **obra/superpowers** - Core skills library for Claude Code with 20+ battle-tested skills including TDD, debugging, and collaboration patterns. Features /brainstorm, /write-plan, /execute-plan commands and skills-search tool.\n\n3. **ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills** - A curated list of practical Claude Skills for enhancing productivity across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and the Claude API. Claude Skills are customizable workflows that teach Claude how to perform specific tasks according to your unique requirements. Skills enable Claude to execute tasks in a repeatable, standardized manner across all Claude platforms.\n\n### Team Knowledge Sharing with Skills\n\nThe core idea is simple. When you finish an experiment session in Claude Code, you type one command. Claude reads through what you did, extracts the important parts and writes it up as a \"skill.\" That skill goes into a shared registry. The next time anyone on the team asks Claude about a related topic, Claude already knows what your teammate discovered.\n\n### Installing Skills\n\nSkills are just markdown files with YAML metadata (super easy to make your own). They're token-efficient (~30-50 tokens until loaded) and work across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and API.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"cc631fea-94e6-4e5f-b311-3dc0aebae777","timestamp":"2026-01-09T18:17:40.393Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Claude Code debug skill community","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01MNHENs3j7TFmmDLV77HRWh","content":[{"title":"Agent Skills - Claude Code Docs","url":"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills"},{"title":"How We Use Claude Code Skills to Run 1,000+ ML Experiments a Day","url":"https://huggingface.co/blog/sionic-ai/claude-code-skills-training"},{"title":"GitHub - VoltAgent/awesome-claude-skills: The awesome collection of Claude Skills and resources.","url":"https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-skills"},{"title":"GitHub - ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills: A curated list of awesome Claude Skills, resources, and tools for customizing Claude AI workflows","url":"https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills"},{"title":"GitHub - travisvn/awesome-claude-skills: A curated list of awesome Claude Skills, resources, and tools for customizing Claude AI workflows — particularly Claude Code","url":"https://github.com/travisvn/awesome-claude-skills"},{"title":"Beyond Coding: Your Accountability Buddy with Claude Code Skill - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/yooi/beyond-coding-your-accountability-buddy-with-claude-code-skill-4omh"},{"title":"I Watched 100+ People Hit the Same Claude Skills Problems in Week One—So I Built 10 Tools to Fix Them","url":"https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/i-watched-100-people-hit-the-same"},{"title":"Claude Code Skills — Equipping Your Claude Code Agents with more Superpowers | by Yee Fei | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@ooi_yee_fei/claude-code-skills-superpowering-claude-code-agents-a42b44a58ae2"},{"title":"discover-debugging - Skills - Claude Code Plugins","url":"https://claude-plugins.dev/skills/@rand/cc-polymath/discover-debugging"},{"title":"10 Claude Skills that actually changed how I work - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/composiodev/10-claude-skills-that-actually-changed-how-i-work-2b58"}]},"Here are the search results for \"Claude Code debug skill community\":\n\n## Claude Code Skills - Overview and Community Resources\n\n### Official Documentation\nA Skill is a markdown file that teaches Claude how to do something specific: reviewing PRs using your team's standards, generating commit messages in your preferred format, or querying your company's database schema.(no content)When you ask Claude something that matches a Skill's purpose, Claude automatically applies it.\n\n**Debugging Skills:**\n- Run debug mode.

This skill auto-activates when you're working with: debugging, GDB, LLDB, profiling, memory leaks, performance analysis, troubleshooting, diagnostics.\n\n### Community Skill Repositories\n\nSeveral community repositories curate Claude Code skills:\n\n1. **VoltAgent/awesome-claude-skills** - Claude Skills are folders with instructions, scripts, and resources that teach Claude specific tasks. Skills can include executable code and are loaded only when needed, allowing you to maintain hundreds without performance impact.\n\n2. **obra/superpowers** - Core skills library for Claude Code with 20+ battle-tested skills including TDD, debugging, and collaboration patterns. Features /brainstorm, /write-plan, /execute-plan commands and skills-search tool.\n\n3. **ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills** - A curated list of practical Claude Skills for enhancing productivity across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and the Claude API. Claude Skills are customizable workflows that teach Claude how to perform specific tasks according to your unique requirements. Skills enable Claude to execute tasks in a repeatable, standardized manner across all Claude platforms.\n\n### Team Knowledge Sharing with Skills\n\nThe core idea is simple. When you finish an experiment session in Claude Code, you type one command. Claude reads through what you did, extracts the important parts and writes it up as a \"skill.\" That skill goes into a shared registry. The next time anyone on the team asks Claude about a related topic, Claude already knows what your teammate discovered.\n\n### Installing Skills\n\nSkills are just markdown files with YAML metadata (super easy to make your own). They're token-efficient (~30-50 tokens until loaded) and work across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and API."],"durationSeconds":23.60213812499866},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"b37150c6-a7a1-425b-8fdc-aadc19363e19"}

Plan Mode for Debugging\nStop treating debugging as iteration and start treating it as investigation. Always start in Plan Mode for debugging tasks.(no content)Press Shift+Tab twice to enter Plan Mode. In this mode, Claude can only read and analyze—it cannot make changes. This forces investigation before action.\n\n### 2. Root Cause Analysis Approach\nAnalyze errors but DO NOT write any code yet. Trace the execution path that leads to the error, identify at least 3 possible root causes, rank them by likelihood, and explain what evidence would confirm each hypothesis.\n\n### 3. Cross-File Investigation\nClaude traces bugs across multiple files, following imports and dependencies to find root causes spanning component boundaries.(no content)For logic bugs, Claude traces through functions step-by-step with sample data, spotting mathematical errors, edge cases, or incorrect data structure assumptions.\n\n### 4. Specialized Debug Agents\nOne Claude session for everything leads to \"context pollution\"—concerns bleed together and conversations become unfocused. The solution is to deploy specialized sub-agents with single, well-defined purposes, such as a \"Debugger Agent\" that only identifies and fixes bugs.\n\n### 5. Browser Integration for Debugging\nConnect the Claude in Chrome extension, and Claude can control your browser directly from the terminal. This is really useful for debugging. Claude can write code, then immediately test it in your browser, see errors, and iterate, all in one workflow. No more switching between terminal and browser to check if something works.\n\n### 6. Using Custom Commands for Debugging Workflows\nFor repeated workflows—debugging loops, log analysis, etc.—store prompt templates in Markdown files within the .claude/commands folder. These become available through the slash commands menu when you type /. You can check these commands into git to make them available for the rest of your team.\n\n### 7. When Stuck in Debug Loops\nWhen multiple fixes haven't worked: STOP. This is a sign you don't understand the problem. Have Claude forget everything you've tried, re-read the original error and relevant code fresh, and explain the problem as if teaching a junior developer.\n\n### 8. Real-World Debugging Success\nClaude Code rapidly figured out a fairly complex low-level bug in an implementation of a relatively novel cryptography algorithm. This demonstrates that developers may still not have a good intuition for when to invoke AI tools for debugging.\n\n### 9.

Using Custom Commands for Debugging Workflows\nFor repeated workflows—debugging loops, log analysis, etc.—store prompt templates in Markdown files within the .claude/commands folder. These become available through the slash commands menu when you type /. You can check these commands into git to make them available for the rest of your team.\n\n### 7. When Stuck in Debug Loops\nWhen multiple fixes haven't worked: STOP. This is a sign you don't understand the problem. Have Claude forget everything you've tried, re-read the original error and relevant code fresh, and explain the problem as if teaching a junior developer.\n\n### 8. Real-World Debugging Success\nClaude Code rapidly figured out a fairly complex low-level bug in an implementation of a relatively novel cryptography algorithm. This demonstrates that developers may still not have a good intuition for when to invoke AI tools for debugging.\n\n### 9. MCP Debug Flag\nWhen working with MCP, it can be helpful to launch Claude with the --mcp-debug flag to help identify configuration issues."],"durationSeconds":26.93438695799932},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"c718ec5f-3d81-4b14-9211-4689b0284e5b"}

Here are the key techniques and prompt strategies found:\n\n### Three Levels of AI Debugging\n\nThere are three main levels of AI-assisted debugging to understand, from \"lazy\" AI debugging to interactive debugging agents that actively explore your code's execution.\n\n1. **Lazy Prompting**: Many developers copy-paste error messages into an LLM without further instructions. Most LLMs are smart enough to figure out that you want them to help understand and propose fixes.(no content)As Andrew Ng notes, \"Lazy prompting is an advanced technique.\" On average, more people give too little context to LLMs than too much. It works best when you've learned how to provide enough context, then deliberately step back to see how little context you can get away with.\n\n2. **Structured Debugging Prompts**: Between basic and fully automated debugging lies the art of crafting structured debugging prompts. This approach treats your AI interaction like a proper bug report, with context, code snippets, and clear expectations, creating a mini-specification that gives the AI exactly what it needs.\n\n3. **AI Debugging Agents**: Tools like Cursor can use error inputs to correct code, but an alternative approach is to give AI regular debugging tools and let it go through the debug cycle itself.\n\n### Key Prompting Techniques\n\nThe best debugging prompts follow a structured analysis with a systematic approach, and are domain-specific, tailored for different technologies and scenarios.\n\n**Tactics for debugging prompts include:**\n- Providing examples of expected output is the easiest way to get better results because examples act like a guide that helps the AI produce results by replication, reducing misinterpretation.\n- Asking for results in JSON can improve quality by providing improved structure that organizes information consistently and reduces ambiguity.\n- Using multi-step instructions allows the AI to approach the task methodically.\n\n### Specific Prompt Examples\n\nFor Python debugging: \"Act as an expert Python debugger and help me identify the error in this function. I'm getting a 'NoneType' error, but I'm not sure why.\"(no content)For error analysis, try prompts like: \"Identify and fix syntax errors in this Python script: [script]\" or \"Analyze this C++ code for logical errors that could cause unexpected behavior.\"\n\n### Chain-of-Thought Prompting\n\nChain-of-thought prompting encourages the model to explain its reasoning step by step, which helps improve logical accuracy in tasks such as debugging, analysis, or planning.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nKey practices align with general prompt-engineering guidance: clarity, context, constraints, and explicit goals, applied specifically to debugging scenarios.(no content)Always verify AI suggestions: rerun tests, scan the diff, and lint your code. Never trust AI-generated fixes without verification.\n\n### AI-Powered Debugging Tools\n\nRecent research has developed AI-powered debugging assistants integrated into IDEs that offer real-time, personalized debugging support by identifying breakpoints, providing explanations, and using techniques like RAG and program slicing.(no content)Tools like the Learning Interpretability Tool (LIT) from Google are open-source tools for visually understanding and debugging AI models that can be used as debuggers for prompt engineering work.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"76211048-59b1-48b7-bd2f-6e5bd7369eef","timestamp":"2026-01-09T18:17:49.076Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"AI assisted debugging prompts techniques","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01GeYiscUNuCrm785K9zoZ2o","content":[{"title":"Top 10 AI Debugging Prompts: A Comprehensive Guide","url":"https://huggingface.co/blog/samihalawa/best-debugging-prompts"},{"title":"The 3 Levels of Debugging With AI - Neon","url":"https://neon.com/blog/the-3-levels-of-debugging-with-ai"},{"title":"Tactics to Debug Generative AI Prompts | AiSDR","url":"https://aisdr.com/blog/leadership-nuggets-tactics-to-debug-generative-ai-prompts/"},{"title":"Enhancing Debugging Skills with AI-Powered Assistance: A Real-Time Tool for Debugging Support","url":"https://arxiv.org/html/2601.02504"},{"title":"What is prompt engineering? · GitHub","url":"https://github.com/resources/articles/what-is-prompt-engineering"},{"title":"ChatGPT: A new-age Debugger, 10 Prompts | by Aditya Sharma | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@shamawali/chatgpt-a-new-age-debugger-10-prompts-20ee3e9c63aa"},{"title":"Prompt debugging with LIT | Responsible Generative AI Toolkit | Google AI for Developers","url":"https://ai.google.dev/responsible/docs/alignment/lit"},{"title":"Debug Your Code with AI | Microsoft Copilot","url":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/for-individuals/do-more-with-ai/general-ai/debug-code"},{"title":"20 Best AI Code Assistants Reviewed and Tested [August 2025]","url":"https://www.qodo.ai/blog/best-ai-coding-assistant-tools/"},{"title":"FREE AI-Powered Code Debugger; Context-Driven AI Debugging","url":"https://workik.com/ai-code-debugger"}]},"Here are the results from my search on AI-assisted debugging prompts and techniques:\n\n## Overview\n\nAI-assisted debugging has become an increasingly important skill for developers.

These become available through the slash commands menu when you type `/`. You can check these commands into git to make them available for the rest of your team.\n\n### Creating Custom Slash Commands\n\nClaude Code supports custom slash commands that you can create to quickly execute specific prompts or tasks. For more details, see the Slash commands reference page.(no content)You can organize commands in subdirectories (for example, `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` creates `/component` with \"(project:frontend)\" shown in the description). Project commands are available to everyone who clones the repository, and the Markdown file content becomes the prompt sent to Claude when the command is invoked.\n\n### Flexible Commands with Arguments\n\nYou can use `$ARGUMENTS` in your prompt templates—this replaces `$ARGUMENTS` with whatever input you provide (like \"123\") in the prompt.\n\n### Debugging Resources\n\nThe \"Superpowers\" resource by Jesse Vincent provides a strong bundle of core competencies for software engineering, with good coverage of a large portion of the SDLC—from planning, reviewing, testing, debugging. The author refers to them as \"superpowers\", but many of them are just consolidating engineering best practices.\n\n### Claude Code Templates Repository\n\nThe claude-code-templates repository offers ready-to-use configurations for Anthropic's Claude Code—a comprehensive collection of AI agents, custom commands, settings, hooks, external integrations (MCPs), and project templates to enhance your development workflow.\n\n### Debugging with Verbose Mode\n\nFor debugging Claude invocations, it can be helpful to use the `--verbose` flag. They generally recommend turning verbose mode off in production for cleaner output.\n\n### Prompt Engineering Best Practices\n\nBy integrating prompts, templates, tricks, and best practices, you can transform Claude Code from a \"good assistant\" into a full-stack productivity engine—delivering faster coding, better tests, superior docs, and clearer reviews.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a81abb3b-efce-43fb-ba95-a5377d20c3c0","timestamp":"2026-01-10T12:35:53.242Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"Claude Code\" debugging prompt template workflow","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01DPiwpoFf8USEBPwfjvNv2E","content":[{"title":"Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices"},{"title":"Common workflows - Claude Code Docs","url":"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows"},{"title":"GitHub - hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code: A curated list of awesome commands, files, and workflows for Claude Code","url":"https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code"},{"title":"The Ultimate Claude Code Debugging Prompt: A Step-by-Step Debugging Workflow That Actually Works | by Code Coup | Coding Nexus | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/coding-nexus/the-ultimate-claude-code-debugging-prompt-a-step-by-step-debugging-workflow-that-actually-works-26b3e38f6e71"},{"title":"Use prompt templates and variables - Claude Docs","url":"https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-templates-and-variables"},{"title":"The Ultimate Guide to Claude Code: Production Prompts, Power Tricks, and Workflow Recipes | by Toni Maxx | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@tonimaxx/the-ultimate-guide-to-claude-code-production-prompts-power-tricks-and-workflow-recipes-42af90ca3b4a"},{"title":"Use prompt templates and variables - Claude Docs","url":"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-templates-and-variables"},{"title":"GitHub - davila7/claude-code-templates: CLI tool for configuring and monitoring Claude Code","url":"https://github.com/davila7/claude-code-templates"},{"title":"ClaudeLog - Claude Code Docs, Guides, Tutorials & Best Practices","url":"https://claudelog.com/claude-code-mcps/awesome-claude-prompts/"},{"title":"Use Claude AI for Frontend Debugging | A Developer's Guide","url":"https://www.arsturn.com/blog/how-to-use-claude-for-frontend-debugging"}]},"Here are the search results for \"Claude Code\" debugging prompt template workflow:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Custom Slash Commands for Debugging Workflows\n\nFor repeated workflows—debugging loops, log analysis, etc.—store prompt templates in Markdown files within the `.claude/commands` folder.

Existing Debug Skills in Claude Code Community\n\n**obra/systematic-debugging** is the most prominent community skill, featuring a four-phase framework:\n- **Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation** - No fixes without understanding the cause first\n- **Phase 2: Pattern Analysis** - Compare broken code against working implementations\n- **Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing** - Form specific hypotheses and test one variable at a time\n- **Phase 4: Implementation** - Create failing test first, implement single fix, verify without breaking tests\n\nThe skill enforces a critical rule: if 3+ fixes fail, question the architecture rather than attempting more patches. It achieves 95% first-time success rates in 15-30 minutes vs. 40% success in 2-3 hours with random fixes.\n\n**discover-debugging** by @rand provides a progressive gateway skill that auto-activates when working with debugging tasks, offering access to 14 specialized debugging skills including GDB, LLDB, memory leak analysis, and performance profiling.\n\n### 2. Best Practices for AI-Assisted Debugging\n\n**Plan Mode First:** Always start debugging in Plan Mode (Shift+Tab twice) - forces Claude to analyze without making changes, preventing premature fixes.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis Prompting:** \"Analyze errors but DO NOT write any code yet. Trace the execution path, identify at least 3 possible root causes, rank by likelihood, explain what evidence would confirm each.\"\n\n**Custom Slash Commands:** Store debugging workflows as markdown files in `.claude/commands/` folder - they become reusable `/` commands checked into git for team sharing.\n\n**Specialized Debug Agents:** Deploy single-purpose agents to avoid \"context pollution\" - separate agents for debugging vs. feature work.\n\n**Browser Integration:** Connect Claude in Chrome extension for write-code-test-iterate debugging loops without manual switching.\n\n**Breaking Debug Loops:** When stuck after multiple failed fixes: STOP, forget all attempts, re-read error fresh, explain problem as if teaching junior developer.\n\n### 3. Systematic Debugging Frameworks\n\n**Five Whys Method:** Originated at Toyota, popularized in software by Lean Startup movement. Ask \"why\" 5+ times to reach root cause instead of addressing symptoms. Often reveals process/management issues, not just code problems. Applied in post-mortems and incident response.\n\n**Scientific Method Approach:**\n- Observation (gather error data)\n- Hypothesis formation (theorize root cause)\n- Testing (minimal change to test one variable)\n- Verification (confirm without breaking other tests)\n\n**Rubber Duck Debugging Evolution:** AI assistants serve as \"rubber ducks that talk back\" - explaining problems to AI forces articulation and clarity. Key advantage: AI can ask clarifying questions and offer suggestions, but core benefit remains in articulating your thoughts clearly.\n\n**Three Levels of AI Debugging:**\n1. **Lazy Prompting** - Copy-paste error messages (works when you've learned to provide sufficient context)\n2. **Structured Debugging Prompts** - Treat AI interaction like proper bug report with context, snippets, clear expectations\n3. **AI Debugging Agents** - Give AI traditional debugging tools and let it run debug cycles autonomously\n\n**Structured Debugging Workflow Elements:**\n- Provide examples of expected output\n- Request JSON format for consistency\n- Use multi-step instructions for methodical approach\n- Chain-of-thought prompting for step-by-step reasoning\n- Always verify AI suggestions - rerun tests, scan diffs, lint code\n\n### 4. Claude's Debugging Effectiveness vs. Struggles\n\n**Where Claude Excels:**\n\n- **Cross-file tracing:** Reads entire codebase, traces execution paths across files, spots subtle bugs spanning components\n- **Runtime errors:** Identifies undefined value origins, prop/state/async issues\n- **Logic bugs:** Traces functions step-by-step with sample data, spots mathematical errors and edge cases\n- **Performance issues:** Analyzes time complexity, Big O notation, identifies rendering and data fetching bottlenecks\n- **Low-level debugging:** Successfully debugged complex cryptography algorithm bugs rapidly\n- **Well-scoped issues:** Particularly good with failing tests that define expected behavior\n\n**Where Claude Struggles:**\n\n- **Cross-file dependencies:** Can miss module-level logic in large projects\n- **Root cause vs. symptoms:** Difficulty distinguishing \"not the problem\" from \"not a problem\" - may mark legitimate bugs resolved if they don't explain the specific issue\n- **Attention mechanism limits:** Large random-looking test outputs don't play well with attention\n- **LLM hard failures:** JSON parsing errors, encoding issues, rate/token limits\n- **LLM soft failures:** Not respecting prompt hints, hallucinating tool outputs\n- **Autonomous limitations:** Too early for complete autonomy - needs human direction about where to look next\n- **Context overload:** If Claude struggles to understand codebase, cognitive load is too high for both AI and human maintainers\n\n**Optimal Approach:** Hybrid model where AI does exhaustive checking and documentation while human provides direction and manual verification.\n\n**⚡ ACTIONS:**\n- Searched 8 different query combinations across web sources\n- Fetched GitHub repositories for community debugging skills\n- Analyzed Claude Code documentation and community resources\n- Cross-referenced debugging frameworks from software engineering practices\n- Examined real-world case studies of Claude debugging successes and failures\n\n**✅ RESULTS:**\n\n## Implementation-Ready Debugging Resources\n\n### Community Skills to Consider\n\n1. **obra/superpowers/systematic-debugging** - Four-phase framework with supporting techniques (root-cause-tracing.md, defense-in-depth.md, condition-based-waiting.md)\n\n2. **discover-debugging by @rand** - Gateway skill with progressive loading of 14 specialized debugging tools\n\n3. **obra/root-cause-tracing** - Backward tracing through call stacks\n\n4. **obra/verification-before-completion** - Validation before finalizing fixes\n\n### Prompt Templates Worth Implementing\n\n**Root Cause Investigation Prompt:**\n```\nBefore proposing any fixes, analyze this error:\n1. Trace the execution path that leads to this error\n2. Identify at least 3 possible root causes\n3. Rank them by likelihood with supporting evidence\n4. Explain what evidence would confirm each hypothesis\n5. Recommend the minimal test to verify the top hypothesis\n\nDO NOT write any code yet.\n```\n\n**Pattern Analysis Prompt:**\n```\nFind similar working code in this codebase that accomplishes [similar goal].\nCompare the broken implementation against the working reference:\n1. List every difference between working and broken versions\n2. Identify all dependencies, settings, and assumptions\n3. Explain which differences could cause the observed behavior\n```\n\n**Five Whys Debugging Prompt:**\n```\nApply the Five Whys method to this bug:\n1. What is the immediate symptom? Why does it occur?\n2. Why does that underlying cause exist?\n3. Why does that deeper cause exist?\n4. Why does that more fundamental cause exist?\n5. Why does that root cause exist?\n\nAfter reaching the root cause, propose a fix that addresses it rather than symptoms.\n```\n\n**Debug Loop Breaker Prompt:**\n```\nWe've attempted multiple fixes without success. STOP all fix attempts.\n1. Forget all previous fix attempts\n2. Re-read the original error message with fresh perspective\n3. Explain the problem as if teaching a junior developer\n4. Question whether the current architecture supports what we're trying to do\n5. Should we refactor vs. continue patching? Discuss options.\n```\n\n### Workflow Structure Recommendations\n\n**Slash Command Template (`.claude/commands/debug.md`):**\n```markdown\n---\ndescription: Systematic debugging workflow\n---\n\n# Systematic Debugging Protocol\n\n## Phase 1: Investigation\n- Read error messages thoroughly\n- Reproduce consistently\n- Check recent git changes\n- Trace data flow backward\n\n## Phase 2: Pattern Analysis\n- Find similar working code\n- Compare all differences\n- List dependencies and assumptions\n\n## Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing\n- Form specific written hypothesis\n- Make minimal change to test it\n- Test one variable at a time\n- Verify before proceeding\n\n## Phase 4: Implementation\n- Create failing test first\n- Implement single fix\n- Verify without breaking other tests\n\n## RED FLAGS\nStop if thinking:\n- \"Quick fix for now\"\n- \"Just try changing X\"\n- \"Skip the test\"\n- \"One more attempt\" (after 2 failures)\n\n## RULES\n- NO fixes without root cause investigation\n- If 3+ fixes fail: question architecture\n- Always use Plan Mode first\n```\n\n**📊 STATUS:** High confidence in findings. Research synthesized from official Claude Code documentation, established community skills repositories (obra/superpowers with 20+ battle-tested skills), software engineering debugging frameworks (Five Whys, scientific method, rubber duck debugging), and real-world case studies. Limitations: Could not access one Medium article due to 403 error, but gathered equivalent information from other sources.\n\n**➡️ NEXT:** \n1. Consider implementing a custom debugging skill based on systematic-debugging framework\n2. Create custom slash commands for common debugging workflows in `.claude/commands/`\n3. Experiment with Plan Mode for debugging tasks\n4. Test the Five Whys prompt template on next debugging session\n5. Explore obra/superpowers repository for additional complementary skills (TDD, verification, root-cause-tracing)\n6. Consider integrating discover-debugging gateway skill for comprehensive tool access\n\n**🎯 COMPLETED:** [AGENT:researcher] completed comprehensive Claude Code debugging research analysis\n\n**🗣️ CUSTOM COMPLETED:** Debugging research complete\n\n---\n\n## Sources:\n\n- [Agent Skills - Claude Code Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)\n- [How We Use Claude Code Skills to Run 1,000+ ML Experiments a Day](https://huggingface.co/blog/sionic-ai/claude-code-skills-training)\n- [VoltAgent/awesome-claude-skills](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-skills)\n- [ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills)\n- [travisvn/awesome-claude-skills](https://github.com/travisvn/awesome-claude-skills)\n- [discover-debugging - Skills - Claude Code Plugins](https://claude-plugins.dev/skills/@rand/cc-polymath/discover-debugging)\n- [Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)\n- [How to use Claude Code for debugging - ClaudeLog](https://claudelog.com/faqs/how-to-use-claude-code-for-debugging/)\n- [Claude Coding Guide 2026: Debugging & Testing](https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/claude-code-mvp-build-2026-guide/)\n- [Stop the Loop: How to Make Claude Code CLI Focus on Root Causes](https://www.virtuallycaffeinated.com/2026/01/06/stop-the-loop-how-to-make-claude-code-cli-focus-on-root-causes-instead-of-chasing-symptoms/)\n- [Claude Code Tutorial: How to Generate, Debug and Document Code with AI](https://www.codecademy.com/article/claude-code-tutorial-how-to-generate-debug-and-document-code-with-ai)\n- [A Guide to Claude Code 2.0](https://sankalp.bearblog.dev/my-experience-with-claude-code-20-and-how-to-get-better-at-using-coding-agents/)\n- [Claude Code Can Debug Low-level Cryptography](https://words.filippo.io/claude-debugging/)\n- [Top 10 AI Debugging Prompts](https://huggingface.co/blog/samihalawa/best-debugging-prompts)\n- [The 3 Levels of Debugging With AI](https://neon.com/blog/the-3-levels-of-debugging-with-ai)\n- [Tactics to Debug Generative AI Prompts](https://aisdr.com/blog/leadership-nuggets-tactics-to-debug-generative-ai-prompts/)\n- [Enhancing Debugging Skills with AI-Powered Assistance](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.02504)\n- [ChatGPT: A new-age Debugger, 10 Prompts](https://medium.com/@shamawali/chatgpt-a-new-age-debugger-10-prompts-20ee3e9c63aa)\n- [A Guide for Debugging LLM Training Data](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/llm-debugging)\n- [5 Best LLMs for Debugging and Error Detection](https://www.index.dev/blog/llms-for-debugging-error-detection)\n- [Debugging LLM Failures: A Comprehensive Guide](https://medium.com/@kuldeep.paul08/debugging-llm-failures-a-comprehensive-guide-to-robust-ai-applications-4d3e07c59df5)\n- [FVDebug: An LLM-Driven Debugging Assistant](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15906)\n- [AwesomeLLM4APR - GitHub](https://github.com/iSEngLab/AwesomeLLM4APR)\n- [LLMDebugger - GitHub](https://github.com/FloridSleeves/LLMDebugger)\n- [obra/superpowers - GitHub](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)\n- [obra/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/blob/main/skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md)\n- [mrgoonie/claudekit-skills - GitHub](https://github.com/mrgoonie/claudekit-skills)\n- [ChrisWiles/claude-code-showcase - GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisWiles/claude-code-showcase)\n- [What is the 5 Whys framework?
