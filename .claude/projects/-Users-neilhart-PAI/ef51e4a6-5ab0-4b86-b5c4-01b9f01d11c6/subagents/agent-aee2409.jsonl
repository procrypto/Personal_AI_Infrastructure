This practice involves articulating challenges, code issues, or process problems to an AI system to gain clarity and discover solutions through the process of detailed explanation.(no content)Generative AI can potentially take on the duck's role in rubber ducky debugging. When faced with a difficult problem, it's extremely easy to turn to a free GenAI service such as ChatGPT and ask, \"Why isn't this working?\" or \"Talk me through this code step by step.\" The debugger can go through the code in parallel with the AI, verifying or disagreeing with its feedback and find the error.\n\n### AI Frameworks and Tools\n\nInstead of solving problems alone, you have an intelligent partner who understands context, asks clarifying questions, and offers insights. DUCK-E doesn't just help you fix bugs - it explains concepts, suggests best practices, and helps you grow as a developer. Real-time feedback means less time stuck and more time shipping code. Unlike generic AI assistants, DUCK-E maintains conversation context, understanding your codebase and the specific problem you're tackling.(no content)The Rubber Duck aids users in systematically dissecting their code issues, promoting a step-by-step approach to debugging that can be more effective than sporadic attempts to fix the problem.\n\n### Systematic Approach\n\nHere's how to best leverage AI in your debugging sessions: First, clearly articulate your issue: what should your code do, and what is it actually doing? Imagine you're explaining it to someone who has no context at all. Next, provide only relevant snippets, enough context without drowning your duck in noise. Finally, actively engage with the AI's questions and suggestions. Don't just ask for answers, but use the dialogue to challenge your own assumptions and deepen your understanding.(no content)\"Miles is your systematic problem-solver. Think of him as that senior developer who's seen every bug pattern in existence. When Cursor gets stuck refactoring, I explain the situation to Miles. He doesn't just listen—he dissects the problem with surgical precision.\"\n\n### Benefits and Considerations\n\nOne of the most important benefits of rubber duck debugging is that all the answers ultimately come from you, through methodical inspection. It helps you find the answer now and teaches you to quickly come to that answer in the future. It helps you practice critical thinking.(no content)AI-powered rubber ducking won't replace traditional debugging or your team's code reviews. But it does offer a helpful middle ground between coding alone and having a conversation partner always available. The goal is not about magically solving your problems, but about helping you understand your problems clearly enough to fix them yourself.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"30c94dd0-dec7-473a-b09b-90997a2613be","timestamp":"2026-01-09T18:09:00.624Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"rubber duck debugging\" AI assistant framework systematic","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01YVW9DC8VHQhaSUjLccnXLg","content":[{"title":"Rubber duck debugging - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"},{"title":"AI Rubber Ducks: The Future of Debugging is Here","url":"https://www.dominguezpablo.com/blog/your-rubber-duck-just-got-replaced-by-aiand-its-about-time"},{"title":"The rubber duck method of debugging explained | TechTarget","url":"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/tip/The-rubber-duck-method-of-debugging-explained"},{"title":"GitHub - jedarden/duck-e: 🦆 DUCK-E: The Duck That Talks Back - An AI-powered voice assistant that revolutionizes rubber duck debugging by actively engaging in your debugging process.

When faced with a difficult problem, it's extremely easy to turn to a free GenAI service such as ChatGPT and ask, \"Why isn't this working?\" or \"Talk me through this code step by step.\" The debugger can go through the code in parallel with the AI, verifying or disagreeing with its feedback and find the error.\n\n### AI Frameworks and Tools\n\nInstead of solving problems alone, you have an intelligent partner who understands context, asks clarifying questions, and offers insights. DUCK-E doesn't just help you fix bugs - it explains concepts, suggests best practices, and helps you grow as a developer. Real-time feedback means less time stuck and more time shipping code. Unlike generic AI assistants, DUCK-E maintains conversation context, understanding your codebase and the specific problem you're tackling.(no content)The Rubber Duck aids users in systematically dissecting their code issues, promoting a step-by-step approach to debugging that can be more effective than sporadic attempts to fix the problem.\n\n### Systematic Approach\n\nHere's how to best leverage AI in your debugging sessions: First, clearly articulate your issue: what should your code do, and what is it actually doing? Imagine you're explaining it to someone who has no context at all. Next, provide only relevant snippets, enough context without drowning your duck in noise. Finally, actively engage with the AI's questions and suggestions. Don't just ask for answers, but use the dialogue to challenge your own assumptions and deepen your understanding.(no content)\"Miles is your systematic problem-solver. Think of him as that senior developer who's seen every bug pattern in existence. When Cursor gets stuck refactoring, I explain the situation to Miles. He doesn't just listen—he dissects the problem with surgical precision.\"\n\n### Benefits and Considerations\n\nOne of the most important benefits of rubber duck debugging is that all the answers ultimately come from you, through methodical inspection. It helps you find the answer now and teaches you to quickly come to that answer in the future. It helps you practice critical thinking.(no content)AI-powered rubber ducking won't replace traditional debugging or your team's code reviews. But it does offer a helpful middle ground between coding alone and having a conversation partner always available. The goal is not about magically solving your problems, but about helping you understand your problems clearly enough to fix them yourself."],"durationSeconds":29.266310499999673},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"edcf036e-dcd4-49b7-8818-55bb97e6d31c"}

This reduces debugging time by 60% compared to random troubleshooting approaches.\n\n### Core Systematic Framework Steps\n\nSeveral sources outline a structured debugging methodology:\n\n1. **Reproduce the Issue**: Create the smallest possible test case that demonstrates the issue. If you can't reproduce it consistently, you can't fix it reliably.\n\n2. **Define Expected vs. Actual Behavior**: Clearly define what should happen vs what is happening. Write down both behaviors—this often reveals the root cause immediately.\n\n3. **Develop Hypotheses**: Based on the symptoms, list 3-5 possible causes in order of likelihood. Don't just guess—use your understanding of the system.\n\n4. **Test Systematically**: Test each hypothesis individually using logging, debugging tools, or isolation.\n\n### The 4-Step Framework\nA disciplined approach—Reproduce, Isolate, Identify, Fix & Verify—is more valuable than raw speed.\n\n### Understanding-First Approach\nOne systematic approach is focused on understanding first and foremost. You need to understand what is going on both to fix it and to be sure it's fixed.(no content)When you can reproduce the bug, resist the temptation to jump into \"proper\" debugging with your debugger. It's better to take a step back and understand the system first.\n\n### Key Debugging Techniques\n\n- **Binary Search/Divide and Conquer**: Binary search is where you divide the code into halves and systematically narrow down the location of the bug.\n\n- **Strategic Breakpoints**: Setting strategic breakpoints in your code where you suspect issues might be hiding allows you to temporarily pause program execution and inspect the state of functionality. Use stepping techniques to move through each line of code methodically, studying variables and data structures for anomalies.\n\n- **Document Your Findings**: Approach debugging in a systematic and methodical manner. Document your findings, hypotheses, and steps taken. This not only aids in tracking progress but also provides a valuable resource for future debugging endeavours.\n\n### Tools and Practices\n\n- Version control systems like Git are essential for debugging, letting developers quickly revert to stable versions of their code. Tools like git bisect automate finding the commit that introduced a bug, testing commits between the current and a stable version, helping isolate the root cause efficiently.\n\n- Designing your program to be easily debuggable is invaluable but rarely discussed. Often this discussion stops at adding logs, but there's much more to it. As a developer, we will often have minimal access to the production environment, so it's incumbent on us to expose any information we need for effective debugging via endpoints or logs.\n\n### Research Context\nDespite decades of research and practice, most developers never learn the skills for debugging systematically and don't know how to properly use debugging tools to support systematic debugging.(no content)Some work shows that following systematic debugging strategies can make novice developers just as effective as experienced ones.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"c4a845d2-78b8-4ad5-a5da-f6a07bfd4ac2","timestamp":"2026-01-09T18:09:35.878Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"debugging framework\" systematic checklist methodology developers","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01PCKtDwfUmvE1uzPBhZeVWq","content":[{"title":"10 effective debugging techniques for developers - WeAreBrain","url":"https://wearebrain.com/blog/10-effective-debugging-techniques-for-developers/"},{"title":"A systematic approach to debugging | nicole@web","url":"https://ntietz.com/blog/how-i-debug-2023/"},{"title":"Effective Debugging Techniques for Developers: Understanding the Importance of Debugging - Code Institute Global","url":"https://codeinstitute.net/global/blog/the-importance-of-debugging/"},{"title":"A framework for methodically debugging any bug | by Veeral Patel | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@veeralpatel/a-framework-for-methodically-debugging-any-bug-406cfe3abcc6"},{"title":"Debugging techniques for developers: practical guide","url":"https://upsun.com/blog/debugging-techniques-for-developers/"},{"title":"Debugging and Troubleshooting Strategies | Hakia","url":"https://www.hakia.com/skills/debugging-strategies/"},{"title":"Debugging Techniques Every Developer Should Know - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/surajondev/debugging-techniques-every-developer-should-know-85f"},{"title":"Debugging Approaches - Software Engineering - GeeksforGeeks","url":"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-debugging-approaches/"},{"title":"The Art of Debugging: Techniques for Troubleshooting","url":"https://www.coders.dev/blog/the-art-of-debugging-techniques-for-efficient-troubleshooting.html"},{"title":"Cooperative Software Development - Debugging","url":"https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/debugging"}]},"Here are the results for your search on debugging frameworks and systematic checklist methodologies for developers:\n\n## Key Findings on Systematic Debugging Frameworks\n\n### The Scientific Method Approach\nThe most effective debuggers follow the scientific method: form hypothesis, test systematically, document findings.

This not only aids in tracking progress but also provides a valuable resource for future debugging endeavours.\n\n### Tools and Practices\n\n- Version control systems like Git are essential for debugging, letting developers quickly revert to stable versions of their code. Tools like git bisect automate finding the commit that introduced a bug, testing commits between the current and a stable version, helping isolate the root cause efficiently.\n\n- Designing your program to be easily debuggable is invaluable but rarely discussed. Often this discussion stops at adding logs, but there's much more to it. As a developer, we will often have minimal access to the production environment, so it's incumbent on us to expose any information we need for effective debugging via endpoints or logs.\n\n### Research Context\nDespite decades of research and practice, most developers never learn the skills for debugging systematically and don't know how to properly use debugging tools to support systematic debugging.(no content)Some work shows that following systematic debugging strategies can make novice developers just as effective as experienced ones."],"durationSeconds":28.53898379199952},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"d030086b-4743-4549-baf9-8b54301c6aae"}

It has two parts: YAML metadata (the section between `---` markers) at the top, and Markdown instructions that tell Claude how to use the Skill.\n\n### Basic Structure\n\nSKILL.md is the core of a skill's prompt. It is a markdown file that follows a two-part structure - frontmatter and content. The frontmatter configures HOW the skill runs (permissions, model, metadata), while the markdown content tells Claude WHAT to do.\n\n### YAML Frontmatter\n\nEvery Skill consists of a directory containing at minimum a SKILL.md file, which is the core of the Skill. This file must start with a YAML frontmatter to hold name and description fields, which are required metadata.(no content)The SKILL.md frontmatter requires name and description fields with specific validation rules: name: Maximum 64 characters, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only, no XML tags, no reserved words. Description: Maximum 1024 characters, non-empty, no XML tags.\n\n### Example Format\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: your-skill-name\ndescription: Brief description of what this Skill does and when to use it\n---\n\n# Your Skill Name\n\n## Instructions\nProvide clear, step-by-step guidance for Claude.\n\n## Examples\nShow concrete examples of using this Skill.\n```\n\n### Optional Frontmatter Fields\n\nYou can use the allowed-tools frontmatter field to limit which tools Claude can use when a Skill is active. You can specify tools as a comma-separated string or a YAML list. When this Skill is active, Claude can only use the specified tools without needing to ask for permission.\n\n### Directory Structure\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources organized as:\n- `scripts/` - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n- `references/` - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n- `assets/` - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n\n### Best Practices\n\nKeep SKILL.md body under 500 lines for optimal performance. If your content exceeds this, split it into separate files using progressive disclosure patterns.(no content)YAML is sensitive to indentation and formatting. Use consistent spacing (usually two spaces, not tabs), avoid special characters in field names, and ensure the frontmatter is wrapped between triple dashes (---) at the beginning and end.\n\n### Known Issue\n\nMulti-line descriptions in YAML frontmatter can cause skills to stop being discovered.

Someone just says \"The login is broken.\" You need details. For example, a good bug report would be: \"Clicking login with valid credentials returns a 401 from the API.\"\n\n### Specialized Agent Approach\n\nOne Claude session for everything leads to \"context pollution\"—concerns bleed together and conversations become unfocused. The solution: Deploy specialized sub-agents with single, well-defined purposes, such as a \"Debugger Agent\" that only identifies and fixes bugs.\n\n### Iterative Debugging Loops\n\nDon't be afraid to let it loop - prompts like \"keep iterating on the build: fix any issues with the terraform config and deployment scripts, run the script, watch the outcome and repeat until it works\" will keep Claude busy.(no content)When Claude struggles, approach from different angles. Rephrase your requirements, break complex tasks into steps, feed in error messages, or provide examples. Like any team member, Claude sometimes needs extra guidance to get unstuck.\n\n### PR Reviews and Bug Detection\n\nClaude finds actual logic errors and security issues. The key is customizing the review prompt.(no content)A focused prompt approach: \"Please review this pull request and look for bugs and security issues. Only report on bugs and potential vulnerabilities you find. Be concise.\"\n\n### Using CLAUDE.md for Context\n\nCreate a CLAUDE.md file in your project root. This is where Claude documents everything it needs to know—architecture decisions, tech preferences, naming conventions, project structure, and coding standards. A good CLAUDE.md is like a comprehensive onboarding doc for a new developer.\n\n### Core Debugging Capabilities\n\nIf your code throws an error, Claude Code identifies the issue and suggests fixes. It can even resolve missing dependencies or performance bottlenecks.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"894bb4fc-5b7e-457b-82aa-7b7c191ae125","timestamp":"2026-01-09T18:10:37.931Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"Claude Code\" debugging prompts effective strategies 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01BcRLxRfob31WdypqFzv4ra","content":[{"title":"Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices"},{"title":"The Ultimate Claude Code Debugging Prompt: A Step-by-Step Debugging Workflow That Actually Works | by Code Coup | Coding Nexus | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/coding-nexus/the-ultimate-claude-code-debugging-prompt-a-step-by-step-debugging-workflow-that-actually-works-26b3e38f6e71"},{"title":"ClaudeLog - Claude Code Docs, Guides, Tutorials & Best Practices","url":"https://claudelog.com/claude-code-mcps/awesome-claude-prompts/"},{"title":"The Ultimate Guide to Claude Code: Production Prompts, Power Tricks, and Workflow Recipes | by Toni Maxx | Nov, 2025 | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@tonimaxx/the-ultimate-guide-to-claude-code-production-prompts-power-tricks-and-workflow-recipes-42af90ca3b4a"},{"title":"A practical guide to debug with Claude Code in 2025","url":"https://www.eesel.ai/blog/debug-with-claude-code"},{"title":"How I use Claude Code (+ my best tips)","url":"https://www.builder.io/blog/claude-code"},{"title":"10 Essential Claude Code Tips: Boost Your AI Coding Productivity in 2025 - Elton’s Blog","url":"https://blog.sixeyed.com/ten-tips-claude-code/"},{"title":"10 Claude Code Productivity Tips For Every Developer in 2026","url":"https://www.f22labs.com/blogs/10-claude-code-productivity-tips-for-every-developer/"},{"title":"How Claude Code Is Transforming AI Coding in 2025","url":"https://apidog.com/blog/claude-code-coding/"},{"title":"Prompting best practices - Claude Docs","url":"https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-4-best-practices"}]},"Here are the search results for effective debugging strategies with Claude Code in 2025:\n\n## Key Findings on Claude Code Debugging Strategies\n\n### Official Best Practices from Anthropic\n\nFor repeated workflows like debugging loops and log analysis, store prompt templates in Markdown files within the `.claude/commands` folder.(no content)These become available through the slash commands menu when you type `/`.(no content)When working with MCP, it can also be helpful to launch Claude with the `--mcp-debug` flag to help identify configuration issues.(no content)You can pipe in a log file, then tell Claude to use a tool to pull in additional context to debug the logs.\n\n### Effective Debugging Prompt Strategies\n\nAmateur debugging approach: \"Hey Claude, I'm getting an error, can you help?\" Professional approach: Provide comprehensive diagnostic context including full error messages with stack traces.(no content)Half the time the bug isn't clear at all.

The solution: Deploy specialized sub-agents with single, well-defined purposes, such as a \"Debugger Agent\" that only identifies and fixes bugs.\n\n### Iterative Debugging Loops\n\nDon't be afraid to let it loop - prompts like \"keep iterating on the build: fix any issues with the terraform config and deployment scripts, run the script, watch the outcome and repeat until it works\" will keep Claude busy.(no content)When Claude struggles, approach from different angles. Rephrase your requirements, break complex tasks into steps, feed in error messages, or provide examples. Like any team member, Claude sometimes needs extra guidance to get unstuck.\n\n### PR Reviews and Bug Detection\n\nClaude finds actual logic errors and security issues. The key is customizing the review prompt.(no content)A focused prompt approach: \"Please review this pull request and look for bugs and security issues. Only report on bugs and potential vulnerabilities you find. Be concise.\"\n\n### Using CLAUDE.md for Context\n\nCreate a CLAUDE.md file in your project root. This is where Claude documents everything it needs to know—architecture decisions, tech preferences, naming conventions, project structure, and coding standards. A good CLAUDE.md is like a comprehensive onboarding doc for a new developer.\n\n### Core Debugging Capabilities\n\nIf your code throws an error, Claude Code identifies the issue and suggests fixes. It can even resolve missing dependencies or performance bottlenecks."],"durationSeconds":25.56421920800209},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"5bfe14fb-1995-40d2-823e-17c5e71a7903"}
