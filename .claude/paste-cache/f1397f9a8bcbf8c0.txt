⏺ SUMMARY: Created BRIEFING.md stakeholder communication artifact with full trail comments.

  ANALYSIS: The new .planning/BRIEFING.md includes:

  Structure:
  1. The Problem We're Solving - Pain point empathy
  2. What You'll Get - Concrete deliverables (commands, flows, UI)
  3. Roadmap - Mermaid gantt chart visualization
  4. Current Progress - Visual progress bars
  5. Discussion Points - 9 questions to gather QA Engineer input
  6. Decisions Needed - Explicit table of pending decisions
  7. Next Steps - Action items
  8. Appendix - Technical context for reference

  Trail Comments: Every section has HTML comments explaining:
  - What the section is for
  - Where the source data comes from
  - How to maintain/update it
  - Clear unwinding instructions at the top

  Unwinding path (if you decide against GSD inclusion):
  TO UNWIND FROM GSD:
  1. This file can be deleted without affecting project execution
  2. No other GSD files depend on this artifact
  3. All source data lives in PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md
  4. This is a presentation layer only - no authoritative data here

  ACTIONS: Created /Users/neilhart/Documents/BONKbot/github/qa-tools/.planning/BRIEFING.md

  RESULTS: Stakeholder briefing ready for your QA Engineer meeting.

  STATUS: Complete. File ready for review and meeting use.

  CAPTURE: BRIEFING.md experimental GSD artifact created with full trail comments for potential unwinding.

  NEXT:
  1. Review the file - want me to open it or read specific sections?
  2. Customize discussion points for your specific meeting?
  3. Export to PDF if needed for sharing?
  4. If this works well, we can formalize the pattern for GSD

  STORY EXPLANATION:
  1. Created BRIEFING.md as experimental GSD stakeholder communication artifact
  2. Synthesizes PROJECT + ROADMAP + STATE into meeting-friendly format
  3. Includes Mermaid gantt chart for visual roadmap
  4. Has 9 discussion points tailored to gather QA Engineer input
  5. Decisions Needed table tracks pending choices requiring stakeholder input
  6. Every section has HTML comments explaining purpose and source
