⏺ TEST PLAN

  Backend is already broadcasting - need to verify frontend receives. Check your frontend console for these:

  ---
  1. position_update (should already be flowing)
  - Backend shows: [WS] Broadcasting 1 positions: Bonk
  - Look for: [Autopilot] position_update event in frontend console
  - ✅ or ❌?

  2. token_list (sent every scan tick)
  - Backend shows in logs each 30s scan
  - Look for: [Autopilot] token_list event in frontend console
  - ✅ or ❌?

  3. config (sent on connect + when changed)
  - Look for: [Autopilot] config event
  - ✅ or ❌?

  4. strategies (sent on connect)
  - Backend shows: [WS] Sending initial state: 6 strategies available
  - Look for: [Autopilot] strategies event
  - ✅ or ❌?

  5. signal (only when rules trigger)
  - Will show when a buy/sell signal fires
  - Can skip for now

  ---
  Then test commands (click buttons in frontend):
  - Toggle a strategy on/off → backend should log command received
  - Close position button → backend should log command received

  ---
  Tell me what you see in the frontend console for each event type.
