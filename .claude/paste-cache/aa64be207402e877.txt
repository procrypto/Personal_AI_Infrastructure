SUMMARY: Phase 26 plan created with 2 tasks for feed adapter testing and full suite validation

  ANALYSIS:
  - Discovery Level: 0 (Skip) - Pure internal work following established test patterns
  - Context Gathered: Prior phases (23-25) built the v2.0 data feed pipeline; feed adapters are pure functions without tests
  - Scope Assessment: Small phase (2 tasks, ~30% context estimate) - appropriate for single plan
  - Task Breakdown:
    a. Create feed adapter unit tests for toMarketDataFeed, toOhlcvFeed, toTradeFeed, toCvdFeed
    b. Run full autopilot test suite to validate no regressions

  ACTIONS:
  - Read STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, PROJECT.md, and prior phase summaries (23-25)
  - Examined feedAdapters.ts, eventParser.ts, messageParser.test.ts
  - Created 26-01-PLAN.md with executable task structure
  - Committed plan: docs(26): create phase plan

  RESULTS:
  - Plan file: .planning/phases/26-integration-testing/26-01-PLAN.md
  - Commit: 60ed224f0

  STATUS: Phase 26 plan complete, ready for execution

  CAPTURE: Phase 26 validates v2.0 frontend data pipeline with feed adapter tests. Backend is already ready (per system reminder from prior session). This completes the v2.0 Backend Integration milestone.

  STORY EXPLANATION:
  1. Phase 26 is the final phase of v2.0 Backend Integration, focused on integration testing
  2. Prior phases 23-25 built the data feed pipeline: protocol types, adapters, and event parser
  3. The feed adapter functions (toMarketDataFeed, toCvdFeed, etc.) transform NATS data to CLI backend format
  4. These pure functions currently have no tests - Phase 26 adds comprehensive test coverage
  5. The event parser already has 8 tests in messageParser.test.ts (validated in Phase 25)
  6. Task 1 creates feedAdapters.test.ts with tests for all 4 adapter functions
  7. Task 2 runs the full autopilot test suite to ensure no regressions
  8. After this phase completes, the v2.0 frontend is validated and ready for CLI backend connection

  COMPLETED: Phase 26 plan created with 2 tasks ready for execution
