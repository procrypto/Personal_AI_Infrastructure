⏺ That's a frontend performance issue - not backend. The React message handlers are blocking the main thread for 150-330ms.

  SUMMARY: Frontend WebSocket message handlers are too slow

  ANALYSIS:
  - Chrome flags handlers taking >50ms as violations
  - These are 150-330ms - 3-6x the threshold
  - Likely causes on frontend side:
    a. Expensive re-renders on every WS message
    b. Not using React.memo / useMemo
    c. State updates triggering cascading re-renders
    d. Processing large payloads synchronously

  Backend is fine - our messages are small and emit quickly. This is frontend React optimization work.

  Frontend fixes to consider:
  - Batch state updates with unstable_batchedUpdates
  - Debounce/throttle high-frequency message handlers
  - Use React.memo on components receiving WS data
  - Move heavy processing to Web Worker

  STATUS: Backend working correctly - frontend needs performance optimization

  COMPLETED: Identified as frontend performance issue, not backend
