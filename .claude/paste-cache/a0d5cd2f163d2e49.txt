Phase 24 Plan 01: Data Feed Implementation Summary

  Data feed pipeline forwarding NATS market data and CVD to CLI backend via WebSocket

  Performance

  - Duration: 3 min
  - Tasks: 3
  - Files modified: 4

  Accomplishments

  - Feed types updated to match backend protocol (type field, correct type names)
  - CVDData interface created matching backend spec exactly
  - Pure adapter functions for MarketData, OHLCV, Trade, and CVD conversion
  - Data forwarder hook integrated into autopilot subscription

  Files Created/Modified

  - feedAdapters.ts - Pure adapter functions for NATS → backend conversion
  - useAutopilotDataForwarder.ts - Hook that subscribes to store and forwards data
  - AutopilotWebsocket.ts - Updated feed types
  - useAutopilotSubscription.ts - Integrated data forwarder hook

  Patterns Established

  - Feed adapter pattern: Pure functions convert NATS messages to backend format
  - Store subscription forwarding: Hook subscribes to store and forwards to backend

  Next Phase Readiness

  - Data feed pipeline active for market_data and CVD
  - OHLCV and Trade feeds defined but not wired yet (can be added when backend needs them)

  ---
  This establishes the pattern Phase 25 follows: extracting pure functions for testability, just like feedAdapters.ts does for data conversion.
