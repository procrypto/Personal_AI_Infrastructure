in this repo there is a production watchlist widget already. it is close to the level of detail we'd want in our
  three screener columns - we could eliminate liquidity and volume columns, use the mcap and price update. instead of
  volume lets use volume trend and if 15m volume is some multiple of 6h volume for example that would be a strong
  uptrend in volume potentially, or the inversre for sell volume.. or if buy volume in the last hour is dropping
  relative to the average of the previous 6h or 24h while sell volume is trending in the other direction that could
  be a sell signal. we could score things in the background to give a volume trend score weighted to the conditions,
  market cap and liquidity. Let's use the Watchlist widget layout in terms of number of style, headings, text format,
  sorting, linked items etc - i.e. steal the watchlist widget for each of our three screener columns, albeit as
  compactly presented as we dare (font sizes etc must remain the same, im shooting for getting this much dloser to
  brand here)
