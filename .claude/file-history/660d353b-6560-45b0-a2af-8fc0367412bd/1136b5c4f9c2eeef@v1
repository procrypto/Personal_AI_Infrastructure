# Generate Workflow

**Main entry point for documentation generation.**

Orchestrates the creation of all human-facing documentation by leveraging SystemMap for codebase understanding.

## Prerequisites

- SystemMap skill must be available
- Repository should have code to document

## Process

### Step 1: Load Codebase Context via SystemMap

```
Invoke SystemMap:Prime for the current repository.

If ai.md doesn't exist:
  -> Suggest running SystemMap:Discover first
  -> Or proceed with direct analysis (slower, less accurate)
```

**What we need from context:**
- Project purpose and description
- Tech stack (languages, frameworks)
- Entry points and main functionality
- API endpoints (if applicable)
- Configuration options
- Dependencies

### Step 2: Audit Existing Documentation

Scan for existing docs:

```bash
# Check for existing documentation
ls -la README.md CHANGELOG.md API.md docs/ 2>/dev/null
```

**Assess each doc:**
- Does it exist?
- When was it last modified?
- Is it comprehensive or stub?
- Does it match current code?

**Output:** Documentation gap analysis

### Step 3: Determine What to Generate

Based on audit, determine actions:

| Doc | Status | Action |
|-----|--------|--------|
| README.md | Missing | Generate from template |
| README.md | Outdated | Update specific sections |
| README.md | Current | Skip |
| API.md | Missing + has API | Generate |
| API.md | Missing + no API | Skip |
| CHANGELOG.md | Missing | Generate from git history |

**Present plan to user for approval before generating.**

### Step 4: Generate Documentation

For each doc to generate/update:

**README.md:**
```
1. Load templates/ReadmeTemplate.md
2. Fill sections from codebase context:
   - Title: from package.json/pyproject.toml name
   - Description: from ai.md or package description
   - Installation: from detected package manager
   - Usage: from main entry points
   - Configuration: from env files, config schemas
   - Contributing: standard or from existing CONTRIBUTING.md
3. Preserve any existing custom sections
4. Write README.md
```

**API.md:**
```
1. Load templates/ApiDocsTemplate.md
2. Scan for API definitions:
   - Express/Fastify routes
   - OpenAPI/Swagger specs
   - GraphQL schemas
   - tRPC routers
3. Extract for each endpoint:
   - Method + path
   - Description
   - Parameters (path, query, body)
   - Response format
   - Auth requirements
4. Generate examples (curl, fetch)
5. Write API.md
```

**CHANGELOG.md:**
```
1. Load templates/ChangelogTemplate.md
2. Analyze git history:
   - Find last tag/release
   - Categorize commits since then
   - Group by type (feat, fix, breaking, etc.)
3. Generate changelog entry
4. Prepend to existing CHANGELOG.md or create new
```

### Step 5: Verify and Report

After generation:

```
1. Verify files were written
2. Run basic quality checks:
   - No empty required sections
   - Links are valid (internal)
   - Code examples have syntax highlighting
3. Report what was created/updated
4. Suggest next steps (review, commit)
```

## Output Format

```
Documentation Generation Complete

Created:
  - README.md (new)
  - API.md (new)

Updated:
  - CHANGELOG.md (added v1.2.0 entry)

Skipped:
  - CONTRIBUTING.md (already current)

Next steps:
  1. Review generated documentation
  2. Run: git diff README.md API.md CHANGELOG.md
  3. Commit: git add -A && git commit -m "docs: generate project documentation"
```

## Error Handling

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| No ai.md exists | Offer to run SystemMap:Discover first |
| Can't detect project type | Ask user for clarification |
| API detection fails | Ask user to point to route files |
| Git history unavailable | Skip changelog, note in output |

## User Approval Gates

**Gate 1:** After Step 3 (before generating)
- Show what will be generated/updated
- Allow user to modify plan

**Gate 2:** After Step 4 (before writing)
- Show preview of generated content
- Allow user to request changes

## Integration Points

- **SystemMap:Prime** - Context loading
- **SystemMap:Discover** - Full codebase analysis if needed
- **GSD** - Can be called as part of project setup
