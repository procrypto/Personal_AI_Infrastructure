## Accumulated Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 03-01 | Separate topicWorker.ts | Keep Topic Mode isolated from existing stream worker |
| 03-01 | Full messages in index | Trade memory for search capability in later plans |
| 03-02 | Pre-computed semantic sets | Privacy and speed over runtime LLM calls |
| 03-02 | Author-based context primary | Captures full user thought better than chronological |
| 03-03 | Inline styles for results | CSS classes caused rendering issues; inline styles reliable |
| 03-03 | AND/OR multi-keyword search | User requested ability to require all keywords match |
| 04-01 | Worker-side date filtering | More efficient than client-side post-processing |
| 04-02 | Client-side filter/sort | No re-search needed, instant feedback on filter changes |
| 04-03 | ZIP export with combined file | Users want both per-chat and chronological combined views |
| 04-04 | localStorage for settings | Simple persistence without backend; follows existing pattern |
