# Roadmap: Token Analysis Autopilot

## Overview

Transform the backend from a data-polling evaluation engine into a pure signal processor. The main app will firehose market data via existing WebSocket connections, this backend evaluates and emits signals. Architecture will be LOIS-ready for future Rust rewrite. Gradual replacement approach — swap each piece when ready.

## Milestones

- [v1.0 Signal Processor Architecture](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md) (Phases 1-3) — SHIPPED 2026-01-09
- v2.0 Frontend Data Feed Integration (Phase 4) — IN PROGRESS
