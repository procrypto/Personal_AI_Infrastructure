## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [01-01]: Union types over enums for JSON compatibility
- [01-01]: Type guards for runtime KV validation
- [01-02]: Double-cast pattern for hset (as unknown as Record<string, unknown>)
- [01-02]: Extract Linear ID from URL for ticket ID when available
- [01-03]: Singleton pattern for event bus with error isolation
- [01-03]: Emitter functions as clean API for dispatching events
- [02-01]: LinearWebhooks.verify() requires Buffer, not string
- [02-01]: InstanceType<typeof LinearWebhooks> for class instance typing
- [02-02]: Empty slackUserId during sync - requires manual mapping or Phase 3 lookup
- [02-02]: Per-user error handling in sync - one failure doesn't abort entire sync
- [03-01]: @slack/bolt for unified event handling and web API
- [03-01]: HTTP receiver mode (not Socket Mode) for Vercel Functions compatibility
- [03-01]: Non-blocking error handling in listener - log but don't throw
- [03-02]: @slack/types for type-safe Block Kit (no 'any' types)
- [03-02]: Event subscriber pattern: lookup LinearMessage → update ticket → post reply
- [03-03]: Minimal Vercel handler (no Bolt) - ExpressReceiver ESM export issue in serverless
- [03-03]: Upstash Redis for KV storage (Vercel KV moved to marketplace)
