# QA Coordination Hub - Stakeholder Briefing

<!--
  GSD ARTIFACT: BRIEFING.md (Experimental)

  PURPOSE: Stakeholder communication layer for GSD projects.
  Synthesizes PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md + STATE.md into meeting-friendly format.

  TO UNWIND FROM GSD:
  1. This file can be deleted without affecting project execution
  2. No other GSD files depend on this artifact
  3. All source data lives in PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md
  4. This is a presentation layer only - no authoritative data here

  MAINTENANCE: Regenerate before meetings using /gsd:briefing (if we build that)
  or manually update from source files.

  Created: 2026-01-13
  Pattern status: EXPERIMENTAL - evaluating for GSD core inclusion

## The Problem We're Solving

<!--
  SECTION: Pain Point (for stakeholder empathy)
  Source: PROJECT.md "Current pain point" section
-->

**Current state:** When Linear posts QA tickets to Slack, it's a free-for-all.

- Testers don't know who should take what
- Tickets sit unclaimed with no visibility
- No way to see queue health at a glance
- Work falls through the cracks

**After this project:** Everyone knows what's in queue, who's working what, and nothing falls through the cracks.

## What You'll Get

<!--
  SECTION: Value Proposition (what stakeholders interact with)
  Source: PROJECT.md Requirements + ROADMAP.md Phase details

  Note: This section should be updated as phases complete.
  Currently reflects full vision, not just completed work.
-->

### Pre-Release QA Flow (Phases 1-6)

```
Linear "QA:Mods" view → qa-tools detects → Replies in Slack thread → Smart assignment → You claim/pass/blocked
```

**What you'll see in Slack:**
- Thread replies under Linear's native messages (no duplicate posts)
- Block Kit UI with **Claim**, **Pass**, **Blocked** buttons
- Assignment suggestions based on expertise, workload, history
- Escalation warnings if tickets go stale (24h, 48h)

**Commands you'll have:**
| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/qa-queue` | See all open tickets and their status |
| `/qa-claim [ticket]` | Claim a ticket for yourself |
| `/qa-my-tickets` | See what's on your plate |

### Ceremony QA Flow (Phase 7)

```
Deployment starts → Ceremony Tracker calls qa-tools → Checklist posted to channel → You complete checks → Callback to Ceremony Tracker
```

### Alert-Triggered QA (Phase 8)

```
Grafana alert fires → qa-tools receives webhook → Notifies appropriate tester → You investigate
```

**Overall:** 35% complete (7 of ~20 plans executed)

**Currently blocked on:** Manual Slack/Vercel configuration for Phase 3 completion

**Velocity:** Averaging 3 minutes per plan execution (very fast iteration)

## Discussion Points

<!--
  SECTION: Meeting discussion prompts
  Purpose: Gather stakeholder input, validate assumptions

  These should be customized before each meeting based on:
  - Current phase and upcoming decisions
  - Known unknowns in the project
  - Areas where stakeholder expertise is valuable
-->

### Validating Our Assumptions

1. **Thread replies vs. new messages** - We're replying in threads under Linear's native Slack messages. Does this match how you'd want to interact, or would separate messages be better?

2. **Assignment suggestions** - The system will suggest who should take a ticket based on expertise, workload, and history. Do you want:
   - Hard assignments (system assigns, you can reassign)?
   - Soft suggestions (system recommends, you claim)?
   - No suggestions (first-come-first-served with visibility)?

3. **Escalation timing** - Current plan is warnings at 24h and 48h for unclaimed tickets. Are these the right thresholds?

### Understanding Your Workflow

4. **Expertise areas** - What are the distinct expertise areas we should track? (e.g., frontend, API, payments, mobile, specific features)

5. **Workload visibility** - What's a healthy number of concurrent tickets for a tester? When should the system consider someone "overloaded"?

6. **Morning routine** - Would a daily summary post be useful? What time? What should it include?

### Ceremony QA Specifics

7. **Checklist format** - What does a deployment QA checklist look like today? Can you share an example?

8. **Completion criteria** - How do you signal "QA complete" for a deployment today?

### Future Ideas

9. **What else would make your life easier?** Open floor for pain points we haven't addressed.

## Decisions Needed

<!--
  SECTION: Explicit decisions requiring stakeholder input
  Purpose: Clear action items that need resolution

  Update after meeting with decisions made.
-->

| Decision | Options | Impact | Decided |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| Assignment model | Hard / Soft / None | Affects Phase 4 design | Pending |
| Escalation thresholds | 24h/48h or custom | Affects Phase 6 | Pending |
| Expertise categories | List TBD | Affects assignment scoring | Pending |
| Morning summary time | TBD | Affects Phase 6 | Pending |

---

## Next Steps

<!--
  SECTION: Action items
  Update after meeting with agreed next steps
-->

**Before next meeting:**
- [ ] Complete Phase 3 (Slack integration working end-to-end)
- [ ] Demo thread reply functionality
- [ ] Gather expertise categories from team

**Decisions to make:**
- [ ] Assignment model (hard/soft/none)
- [ ] Escalation timing
- [ ] Morning summary preferences

## Appendix: Technical Context

<!--
  SECTION: Technical details for reference
  Source: PROJECT.md Constraints + Context

  Keep brief - this is for context, not deep technical discussion
-->

**Stack:** TypeScript, Vercel Functions, Vercel KV, Slack Bolt SDK

**Integrations:**
- **Linear** - Webhook for "QA:Mods" view events, API for user sync
- **Slack** - Events API for message capture, Web API for posting
- **Ceremony Tracker** - Webhook receiver (Phase 7)
- **Grafana** - Alerting webhook (Phase 8)

**What this doesn't replace:**
- Linear's native Slack integration (we reply in threads, not replace)
- Your Playwright test automation (separate repo, you own it)
- Any existing workflows (this adds visibility layer)
