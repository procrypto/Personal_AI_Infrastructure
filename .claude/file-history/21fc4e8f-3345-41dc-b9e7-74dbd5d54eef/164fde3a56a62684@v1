# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-01-12)

**Core value:** Feature parity — all 37 UI features from dash-pauls must work in the unified architecture
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Data Accuracy

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 7 (Data Accuracy)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-13 — Completed 04-02-PLAN.md

Progress: ██████░░░░ 43%

**Phase 4 Progress:**

- 04-01-PLAN.md: Store data normalization ✓
- 04-02-PLAN.md: Badge holdingPercent token-based ✓

**Phase 4 complete. Ready for Phase 5.**

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 10 min
- Total execution time: 0.8 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total  | Avg/Plan |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 1     | 2/2   | 15 min | 7.5 min  |
| 2     | 1/?   | 19 min | 19 min   |
| 3     | 1/?   | 5 min  | 5 min    |
| 4     | 1/2   | 4 min  | 4 min    |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-02 (5 min), 02-01 (19 min), 03-01 (5 min), 04-01 (4 min)
- Trend: ↓ (focused fixes execute faster)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- New branch (feat/trenchbench-unified) to preserve source branches for rollback
- Merge dash-pauls INTO preload-data (preload-data has cleaner architecture)
- Keep CustomEvents during merge for lower risk validation
- **[01-01]** Resolve all conflicts in single commit (git doesn't allow partial merge commits)
- **[01-01]** Keep trenchBenchStore from preload-data as primary data source
- **[01-01]** Token amount tracking for position exit detection (not SOL amounts)
- **[01-02]** TypeScript verification sufficient for merge (Tolgee i18n is external service)
- **[02-01]** Badge holdingPercent uses SOL amounts (functional; token amounts enhancement for future)
- **[03-01]** useShallow for Anomalyzer store subscription to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **[03-01]** Fixed ESLint unused vars in Vantage (underscore prefix) during Task 2
- **[04-01]** Lamports detection pattern: rawSol >= 1M && no decimal → lamports (divide by 1e9)
- **[04-01]** Position removal uses holdingsMatrix token balance (not SOL amounts) for accuracy

### Deferred Issues

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
