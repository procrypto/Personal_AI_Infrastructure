# Phase 7 Plan 01: Integration & PR Summary

**Final verification passed, PROJECT.md updated with completion status, PR creation deferred for manual testing**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-13T02:08:46Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-13T02:15:18Z
- **Tasks:** 3 completed, 1 deferred
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Verified web-terminal TypeScript check passes (no regressions)
- Updated PROJECT.md with all 10 requirements marked complete
- Updated all 7 Key Decisions to Done status
- Added Final Summary section documenting branch scope

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Final build verification** - No commit (verification only, passed)
2. **Task 2: Update PROJECT.md with final status** - `ab6165611` (docs)
3. **Task 3: PR decision checkpoint** - User selected `defer-pr`
4. **Task 4: Create PR** - Skipped per user decision

**Plan metadata:** (this commit)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/PROJECT.md` - Marked all requirements complete, updated decisions, added final summary

## Decisions Made

- PR creation deferred per user request for additional manual testing before creating PR

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed as written, with PR deferred at checkpoint per user choice.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Debugging Sessions

None - all verifications passed on first attempt.

## Quality Gate

**Verdict:** PASS

**Checks:**

- [x] Implementation matches plan intent
- [x] All claims substantiated by commits
- [x] Evidence trail complete
- [x] No unverified confident assertions

**Notes:** Tasks 1-2 complete. PR deferred at user's decision point - not a failure, legitimate checkpoint outcome.

## Next Step

When ready to create PR:
```bash
gh pr create --base develop-ui --title "feat(trenchbench): unify dash-pauls UI features with preload-data architecture" --body "..."
```

Or run `/gsd:execute-plan` again and select `create-pr` at the checkpoint.

## Project Status

**Branch unification work complete.** All 6 implementation phases finished:
- Phase 1: Branch Foundation (merge + conflict resolution)
- Phase 2: Intel Grid Features (validation)
- Phase 3: Cross-Widget Sync (store subscriptions)
- Phase 4: Data Accuracy (lamports detection, token tracking)
- Phase 5: Anomalyzer & Exfil (pre-merged)
- Phase 6: Store Migration (CustomEvent removal)

PR pending user's manual testing and approval.
