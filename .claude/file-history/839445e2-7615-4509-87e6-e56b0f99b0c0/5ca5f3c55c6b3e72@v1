- [01-03]: Singleton pattern for event bus with error isolation
- [01-03]: Emitter functions as clean API for dispatching events
- [02-01]: LinearWebhooks.verify() requires Buffer, not string
- [02-01]: InstanceType<typeof LinearWebhooks> for class instance typing
- [02-02]: Empty slackUserId during sync - requires manual mapping or Phase 3 lookup
