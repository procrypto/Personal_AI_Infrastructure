- 03-01-PLAN.md: Cross-widget store sync ✓

**Ready for next sync plan or Phase 4**

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 11 min
- Total execution time: 0.73 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total  | Avg/Plan |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 1     | 2/2   | 15 min | 7.5 min  |
| 2     | 1/?   | 19 min | 19 min   |
| 3     | 1/?   | 5 min  | 5 min    |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (10 min), 01-02 (5 min), 02-01 (19 min), 03-01 (5 min)
- Trend: ↓ (feature implementation faster than validation)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- New branch (feat/trenchbench-unified) to preserve source branches for rollback
- Merge dash-pauls INTO preload-data (preload-data has cleaner architecture)
- Keep CustomEvents during merge for lower risk validation
- **[01-01]** Resolve all conflicts in single commit (git doesn't allow partial merge commits)
- **[01-01]** Keep trenchBenchStore from preload-data as primary data source
- **[01-01]** Token amount tracking for position exit detection (not SOL amounts)
- **[01-02]** TypeScript verification sufficient for merge (Tolgee i18n is external service)
- **[02-01]** Badge holdingPercent uses SOL amounts (functional; token amounts enhancement for future)
- **[03-01]** useShallow for Anomalyzer store subscription to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **[03-01]** Fixed ESLint unused vars in Vantage (underscore prefix) during Task 2

### Deferred Issues

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
