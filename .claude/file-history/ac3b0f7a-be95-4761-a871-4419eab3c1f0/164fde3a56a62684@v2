## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- New branch (feat/trenchbench-unified) to preserve source branches for rollback
- Merge dash-pauls INTO preload-data (preload-data has cleaner architecture)
- Keep CustomEvents during merge for lower risk validation
- **[01-01]** Resolve all conflicts in single commit (git doesn't allow partial merge commits)
- **[01-01]** Keep trenchBenchStore from preload-data as primary data source
- **[01-01]** Token amount tracking for position exit detection (not SOL amounts)
- **[01-02]** TypeScript verification sufficient for merge (Tolgee i18n is external service)
- **[02-01]** Badge holdingPercent uses SOL amounts (functional; token amounts enhancement for future)
- **[03-01]** useShallow for Anomalyzer store subscription to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **[03-01]** Fixed ESLint unused vars in Vantage (underscore prefix) during Task 2
- **[04-01]** Lamports detection pattern: rawSol >= 1M && no decimal → lamports (divide by 1e9)
- **[04-01]** Position removal uses holdingsMatrix token balance (not SOL amounts) for accuracy
- **[04-02]** holdingPercent uses token amounts (currentTokens/entryTokens), not SOL values (price-independent)
- **[06-01]** Remove all cross-widget CustomEvent code; store subscriptions (Phase 3) are sole sync mechanism
- **[07-01]** PR creation deferred for manual testing before creating PR

### Deferred Issues
