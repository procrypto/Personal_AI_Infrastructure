# web-terminal - Synthesized Context

## Discovery Summary
- **First discovered**: 2025-01-10 (pre-existing documentation)
- **Last updated**: 2025-01-10
- **Discovery source**: Existing ai.md + BACKEND_API_AND_DATA.md
- **Documentation quality**: Excellent

## System Identity

**What it is**: Rust-based real-time cryptocurrency/token market data backend for BONKbot.

**What it does**:
- Processes Solana blockchain events from Geyser streams (GB/s scale)
- Materializes aggregated market data (OHLCV, holder stats, trading metrics)
- Serves data via REST APIs and WebSockets
- Stores in RocksDB (hot state) and ClickHouse (historical)

**Critical constraints**: Low latency and high throughput are paramount.

## Key Capabilities

### Data It Provides
| Capability | Interface | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| Real-time trades | WebSocket (`trades2.*`) | Enriched with flags (dev, sniper, bundler) |
| Market data | WebSocket (`market_data.*`) | Price, mcap, volume, holders |
| OHLCV candles | REST + WebSocket | Multiple resolutions (1s to 1w) |
| Holder statistics | REST + WebSocket | Top holders, PnL, positions |
| Token events | WebSocket | Lifecycle events, dev actions |
| X-Ray stages | WebSocket | New pair, graduating, graduated |
| Wallet tracking | REST + WebSocket | Trade monitoring for specific wallets |
| Discovery/trending | REST + WebSocket | Trending tokens, whale moves |

### Data Sources It Consumes
| Source | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Geyser RPC | Stream | Raw Solana blockchain events |
| PUM3 | NATS | Processed on-chain events |
| Pyth | Oracle | SOL/USD price feed |

## Architecture Quick Reference

### Services
| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `wt-initializer` | Geyser event processing |
| `wt-materializer` | State aggregation, RocksDB |
| `wt-ch-writer` | ClickHouse persistence |
| `wt-web-server` | REST + WebSocket serving |
| `wt-nats` | Message hub |

### Data Flow
```
Geyser → Initializer → NATS → Materializer → RocksDB (state)
                                    ↓
                              NATS topics → web-server → Frontend
                                    ↓
                              ch-writer → ClickHouse (history)
```

## Working Here

### Entry Points for Common Tasks
| Task | Location |
|------|----------|
| Add REST endpoint | `bin/web-server/src/api/` |
| Add WebSocket topic | `crates/primitives/src/nats/topics.rs` |
| Add ClickHouse table | `crates/storage/src/clickhouse/` |
| Add Geyser processor | `bin/initializer/src/processors/` |
| Modify materialization | `bin/materializer/src/core/event_handler.rs` |

### Patterns to Follow
- `Result<T, E>` for all fallible operations
- Use `?` operator, avoid unwrap except at top-level
- Structured logging with `tracing`
- Performance-first: minimize allocations in hot paths

### Things to Avoid
- Hardcoding instance names in docs
- Duplicating content from code/scripts
- Pushing directly to main
- Skipping PR review process

## Cross-System Connections

### Upstream (What It Consumes)
| System | What We Get | Interface |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Geyser | Raw blockchain events | gRPC stream |
| PUM3 | Processed events | NATS topics |

### Downstream (What Consumes Us)
| System | What They Get | Interface |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Frontend | Real-time market data | WebSocket |
| web-api | Market data queries | REST (assumed) |
