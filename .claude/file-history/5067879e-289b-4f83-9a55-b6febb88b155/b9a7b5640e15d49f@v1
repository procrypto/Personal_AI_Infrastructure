## Registry Maintenance

### Adding a System
1. Run `Discover` workflow on the repo
2. Entry is automatically added here
3. Cross-system maps updated if connections found

### Quality Ratings
- **Excellent**: Complete ai.md, all sections filled, cross-system context documented
- **Good**: ai.md exists with most sections, minor gaps
- **Needs Update**: ai.md exists but stale or missing sections
- **Not Mapped**: No ai.md, needs Discover workflow

### Refresh Schedule
- Re-run Discover after significant codebase changes
- Review registry monthly for staleness
- Update cross-system maps when integrations change
