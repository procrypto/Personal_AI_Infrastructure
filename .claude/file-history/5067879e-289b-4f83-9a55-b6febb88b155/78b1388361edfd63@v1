# team-skills - Synthesized Context

## Discovery Summary
- **First discovered**: 2026-01-10
- **Last updated**: 2026-01-10
- **Discovery depth**: Standard
- **Documentation quality**: Excellent
- **Creator**: Victor (vem) - Senior Data Expert, FAANG background

## System Identity

**What it is**: Shared Claude Code skills repository for the BonkBot team.

**What it does**:
- Extends Claude's capabilities with team-specific skills
- Provides quality evaluation via Judge skill
- Standardizes documentation patterns (ADRs, diagrams)
- Enables visual capture for documentation

**Key insight**: The Judge skill (FM1-FM7) is particularly sophisticated - codifies epistemic standards for evaluating AI outputs. Similar to PAI's judge gate pattern but with different failure mode taxonomy.

## Skills Inventory

| Skill | Purpose | Triggers |
|-------|---------|----------|
| telemetry-judge | Adversarial quality evaluation | "judge this", "evaluate output" |
| telemetry-webapp-screenshot | Playwright visual capture | "take screenshot", "capture webapp" |
| mermaid-architecture | Mermaid diagram generation | "architecture diagram", "flowchart" |
| adr | Architectural Decision Records | "create ADR", "document decision" |
| telemetry-bootstrap | Create new skills repos | "create skills repo" |

## Judge Skill Deep Dive

**Core Concept:** Generous skepticism - assume good intent, question everything.

### Seven Failure Modes

| FM | Name | Key Question |
|----|------|--------------|
| FM1 | Dressed-Up Universals | Would this surprise an MBA student? |
| FM2 | Assertion Without Demonstration | Show me the evidence |
| FM3 | False Comprehensiveness | Does value hit in 10 seconds? |
| FM4 | Confidence-Calibration Failures | Is certainty appropriate? |
| FM5 | Scope Blur | Is this within defined mission? |
| FM6 | Tiger-Style Mimicry | Does it explain *why*, not just *what*? |
| FM7 | Confidence Games | Is there primary evidence? |

**FM7 is the Cardinal Sin** - presenting unverified claims as established fact.

### Verdict Output
```
VERDICT: [PASS / REVISE / REJECT]
- If PASS: What makes this valuable?
- If REVISE: Specific weaknesses + what to change
- If REJECT: Which FM triggered + why unfixable
```

## Integration Opportunities

### With PAI
- Judge skill aligns with PAI's JudgeGate workflow
- Different failure mode taxonomy could complement
- Team-skills uses `telemetry-*` prefix, PAI uses TitleCase

### With SystemMap
- ADR skill useful for documenting cross-system decisions
- Mermaid skill useful for architecture diagrams in ai.md files

## Working Here

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone git@github.com:BonkBotTeam/team-skills.git
cd team-skills
make install
```

### Common Locations
| Task | Path |
|------|------|
| Add skill | `skills/telemetry-<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Modify install | `scripts/install.sh` |
| Track progress | `PROGRESS.md` |

## Session Notes

*Accumulated learnings:*

- Created 2026-01-08 by Victor (vem), 14 commits
- 5 skills: judge, screenshot, mermaid, adr, bootstrap
- Judge skill represents "James's" epistemic standards
- Uses symlinks to `~/.claude/skills/` for hot-reload
- PROGRESS.md pattern for session memory (similar to PAI History)
- Ralph Loop integration for iterative refinement with quality gates
- Future skills planned: solana-patterns, bonkbot-api, clickhouse-queries
