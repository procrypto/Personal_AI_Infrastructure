# Context for team-skills

Context and rules for Claude Code sessions working in this repository.

## Project Overview

Shared Claude Code skills repository for the BonkBot team. Provides team-specific capabilities, workflows, and quality standards as reusable skills that extend Claude's functionality.

Created by Victor (vem), senior data expert with FAANG background. Skills follow the `telemetry-*` naming convention for team identification.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Runtime | Claude Code Skills | Claude capability extension |
| Distribution | Symlinks + .skill packages | Install via `make install` |
| Format | MADR-style SKILL.md | YAML frontmatter + markdown |

## Available Skills

### telemetry-judge (Core)

**Purpose:** Adversarial quality evaluation representing "James's" epistemic standards.

**Triggers:** "judge this", "evaluate output", "review quality", "is this good enough"

**Key Concepts:**

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Generous Skepticism | Assume good intent, question everything |
| Surface vs Substance | Does it *actually work* vs *look right*? |
| Specificity as Proof | Generic = disqualifying |

**Seven Failure Modes (FM1-FM7):**

| FM | Name | Detection |
|----|------|-----------|
| FM1 | Dressed-Up Universals | Would this surprise an MBA student? |
| FM2 | Assertion Without Demonstration | "Show me the messages" |
| FM3 | False Comprehensiveness | 10-second rule - does value hit immediately? |
| FM4 | Confidence-Calibration Failures | Stating uncertain things with confidence |
| FM5 | Scope Blur | Including "for completeness" not purpose |
| FM6 | Tiger-Style Mimicry | *What* vs *why/how* |
| FM7 | Confidence Games (Cardinal Sin) | Unverified claims as fact |

**Verdicts:** PASS / REVISE / REJECT

### telemetry-webapp-screenshot

**Purpose:** Playwright-based screenshot and GIF capture for web apps.

**Triggers:** "take screenshot", "capture webapp", "record demo"

**Capabilities:**
- Single/full-page/element screenshots
- Multi-step workflow capture
- GIF creation from sequences
- Video recording
- SSH tunnel support for remote apps

### mermaid-architecture

**Purpose:** Generate GitHub-native Mermaid diagrams.

**Triggers:** "architecture diagram", "system diagram", "flowchart", "sequence diagram"

**Diagram Types:** flowchart, sequenceDiagram, erDiagram, stateDiagram-v2, classDiagram, gitGraph, journey

### adr (Architectural Decision Records)

**Purpose:** Document significant technical decisions using MADR format.

**Triggers:** "create ADR", "document decision", "why did we choose"

**Structure:** Context → Decision Drivers → Options → Outcome → Consequences

**Status Lifecycle:** proposed → accepted → [deprecated | superseded]

### telemetry-bootstrap

**Purpose:** Guide for creating new team skills repositories.

**Triggers:** "create skills repo", "bootstrap skills", "set up team skills"

## Working in This Repo

### Standards & Conventions

- Skill names prefixed with `telemetry-` for namespace
- Every skill has `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter
- `USE WHEN` in description field for trigger phrases
- Keep SKILL.md concise - use `references/` for details

### Common Tasks

#### Installing Skills

```bash
# Install all skills
make install

# Install specific skill
make install SKILL=telemetry-judge

# List available
make list
```

#### Creating a New Skill

```bash
mkdir skills/telemetry-myskill
cat > skills/telemetry-myskill/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: telemetry-myskill
description: What it does. USE WHEN user says "trigger", OR needs capability.
version: 1.0.0
---

# My Skill

Instructions for Claude...
EOF

make install SKILL=telemetry-myskill
```

#### Packaging for Distribution

```bash
make package SKILL=telemetry-judge
# Creates dist/telemetry-judge.skill
```

### Finding Code

| Task | Location |
|------|----------|
| Add new skill | `skills/telemetry-<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Modify install logic | `scripts/install.sh` |
| Add reference docs | `skills/<name>/references/` |
| Track progress | `PROGRESS.md` |

### Things to Avoid

- Don't use generic skill names (prefix with `telemetry-`)
- Don't make SKILL.md too long - Claude is smart
- Don't skip the `USE WHEN` in description
- Don't commit .skill files (they're generated)

## Cross-System Context

### Integration Points

| System | Integration |
|--------|-------------|
| Claude Code | Skills extend Claude's capabilities |
| PAI | Similar skill system - potential alignment |
| web-terminal-frontend-tests | Could use screenshot skill |

### Quality Workflow

```
Work Session N
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ telemetry-  │
│   judge     │
└─────┬───────┘
      │
      ├── PASS → Output advances
      ├── REVISE → Session N+1 gets feedback
      └── REJECT → Must reformulate approach
```

### Ralph Loop Integration

For iterative refinement with quality gates:

```bash
/ralph-loop "Write X. Use /judge to evaluate. Output <promise>PASS</promise> when Judge returns PASS." --completion-promise "PASS" --max-iterations 5
```

## Configuration

### Installation Location

Skills symlinked to `~/.claude/skills/`

### SKILL.md Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name           # Required
description: ...           # Required - includes USE WHEN triggers
version: 1.0.0            # Optional
---
```

- `solana-patterns` - Solana dev conventions
- `bonkbot-api` - Internal API documentation
- `clickhouse-queries` - Analytics schema and patterns
- `incident-response` - PagerDuty runbooks
- `pr-review` - Team code review checklist
