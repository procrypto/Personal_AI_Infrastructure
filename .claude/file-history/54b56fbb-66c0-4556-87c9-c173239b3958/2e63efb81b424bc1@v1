# TrenchBench API

**One-liner:** Production-ready ClickHouse-backed API service for Community Tracker and TrenchBench.

## Vision

Transform the existing local-api development tool into a production-grade service that can run locally for development, on beta for testing, and in production for Paul and Neil to be self-sufficient with custom TrenchBench queries and endpoints.

## Context

**Origin:** Built as a local development tool to mirror production ClickHouse endpoints. The team (Arthur, Karol) identified it could serve as a cloud service following the ferris-the-sentinel deployment pattern.

**Stakeholders:**
- Neil - Primary developer, endpoint creator
- Paul - End user, Community Tracker work
- Arthur - Infrastructure, GCP IAM setup
- Karol - Beta/prod deployment pipeline

**Target Repo Name:** `trenchbench-api` (rename from `local-api`)

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ HTTP API server with Elysia/Bun — existing
- ✓ ClickHouse Cloud API integration — existing
- ✓ 15+ endpoint modules (trades, search, discovery, trending, etc.) — existing
- ✓ Pluggable extension system — existing
- ✓ Environment-based configuration — existing
- ✓ Validation/Build/Format endpoint pattern — existing
- ✓ SQL injection prevention (escapeString, buildInList) — existing
- ✓ Environment-aware configuration (local/remote modes) — v1.0
- ✓ Different ClickHouse endpoints per environment — v1.0
- ✓ GCP Cloud Run deployment following ferris-the-sentinel pattern — v1.0
- ✓ GitHub Actions CI/CD (beta on `main`, prod on `v*` tags) — v1.0
- ✓ Multi-stage Dockerfile for Bun/TypeScript — v1.0
- ✓ Secret management via GCP Secret Manager — v1.0
- ✓ Workload Identity Federation authentication — v1.0
- ✓ Clean TypeScript compilation (0 errors) — v1.1
- ✓ CI hardening (HEALTHCHECK, Buildx caching, resource limits) — v1.1
- ✓ Complete workflow secrets configuration — v1.1

### Active

- [ ] Repository renamed to `trenchbench-api` (pending Karol)
- [ ] First successful deployment to beta
- [ ] First successful deployment to prod

### Out of Scope

- Auth/rate limiting — handled by infra team separately
- New endpoints — focus on deployment, not new features
- Monitoring/observability infrastructure — defer to later milestone

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Follow ferris-the-sentinel pattern | Team familiarity, proven GCP integration, minimal human setup | — Pending |
| Different ClickHouse endpoints per env | Beta and prod have separate ClickHouse instances | — Pending |
| Rename to trenchbench-api | Per Karol: "local api could mean anything" | — Pending |
| Keep Bun/Elysia stack | Already working, Bun has native Dockerfile support | — Pending |

## Constraints

**Technical:**
- Must maintain local development workflow (zero disruption)
- Must use existing stack (Bun/Elysia) - no framework changes
- GCP Cloud Run deployment (team standard)

**Dependencies:**
- Arthur: Add repo to GCP IAM list
- Karol: Structured beta/prod deploy path (in progress)

## Deployment Architecture

**Target Pattern (from ferris-the-sentinel):**

| Environment | Trigger | GCP Project | ClickHouse |
|-------------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Local | `bun dev` | N/A | Dev credentials |
| Beta | Push to `main` | bonkbotbeta | Beta instance |
| Production | Push `v*` tag | data-backend-prod | Prod instance |

**Infrastructure:**
- Container: GCP Artifact Registry
- Runtime: GCP Cloud Run (4Gi RAM, 2 CPU, 1-3 instances)
- Auth: Workload Identity Federation (no service account keys)
- Secrets: GCP Secret Manager (ClickHouse credentials)
- Network: VPC egress for internal services

**Files to Create:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — Beta deployment
- `.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml` — Production deployment
- `Dockerfile` — Multi-stage Bun build
- `.dockerignore` — Build exclusions
- `.env.example` — Environment template update

## Success Criteria

**v1 Complete When:**
- [ ] Can switch between local/beta/prod with config only (no code changes)
- [ ] Successfully deployed to GCP beta environment
- [ ] Local development workflow unchanged
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines working (main → beta, v* → prod)
