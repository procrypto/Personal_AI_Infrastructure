## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- LOIS documentation is a cross-cutting quality gate for all phases
- Recommend lois-adapter.ts pattern for format conversions at WebSocket boundary
- Autopilot plugin checks directory existence before spawning
- Extract pure functions for testability (calculatePnL, parseAutopilotEvent)
- Local-api batch endpoint has bug (returns empty if any mint invalid) - workaround in place

### Deferred Issues

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

- v1.0 archived: Autopilot Frontend Integration (4 phases, 4 plans)
