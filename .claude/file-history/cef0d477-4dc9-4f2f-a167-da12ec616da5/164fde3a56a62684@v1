### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Merge dash-pauls INTO preload-data (preload-data has cleaner architecture)
- Keep CustomEvents during merge for lower risk validation
- **[01-01]** Resolve all conflicts in single commit (git doesn't allow partial merge commits)
- **[01-01]** Keep trenchBenchStore from preload-data as primary data source
- **[01-01]** Token amount tracking for position exit detection (not SOL amounts)
