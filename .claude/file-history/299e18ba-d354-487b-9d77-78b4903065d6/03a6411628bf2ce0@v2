# Token Analysis Autopilot

> Configurable analysis rules that trigger automated trades via LOIS - with paper trading to prove it works.

## Why This Matters

Users want to automate trading decisions but the "complex logic" for analysis has always been seen as too hard to build. This proves that with Claude-assisted development, you can ship a configurable analysis engine in days, not months. Plus, paper trading shows users exactly what they would have made - proof of value, not just promises.

## The Demo Moment

Live demo showing:
1. User configures analysis rules (price patterns, momentum triggers)
2. Rules fire against real market data
3. Mock LOIS trade signals execute
4. **Paper trading P&L updates in real-time: "Your rules made +$X"**

The "holy shit" is not the analysis - it's the **tracked performance proving the analysis works**.

## What I'll Learn

- Claude Code workflow (full development cycle, not just prompting)
- Building configurable rule engines
- Integrating with existing systems (LOIS mock)

## Build Plan

### Day 1: Foundation + AI Proof

**Goal:** Claude responding to token data / analysis logic generation

- [ ] Set up dev environment with Claude Code
- [ ] Connect to trading terminal API (data source)
- [ ] Build first analysis template with Claude's help (price pattern detection)
- [ ] Test: given token data, does analysis run correctly?

**EOD Check:** Can run a basic price pattern analysis on a token and get results

### Day 2: Core Features + LOIS Integration

**Goal:** Analysis rules trigger mock trades + tracking works

- [ ] Build momentum/volume analysis template
- [ ] Create user configuration interface (ugly but functional)
- [ ] Implement mock LOIS trigger when criteria met
- [ ] Add paper trading P&L tracking
- [ ] Test: full loop from config -> analysis -> trigger -> P&L update

**EOD Check:** Can configure a rule, have it fire, see mock trade and P&L

**Decision Point:** If behind, activate Failsafe

### Day 3: Polish + Demo Prep

**Goal:** Demo-ready by EOD

- [ ] Polish critical path (happy path must be smooth)
- [ ] Pre-configure compelling demo rules
- [ ] Seed paper trading with impressive P&L history
- [ ] Practice demo flow end-to-end
- [ ] Handle demo edge cases (what if API slow? what if no triggers?)

**Demo Day:**

- [ ] Final test run
- [ ] Backup: screenshots/recording if live fails
- [ ] Prepare "here's the P&L this week" narrative

## Resources

**Tools:** Claude Code (primary)

**APIs:**
- Trading terminal API (data source)
- LOIS API (mock for demo, real for production)

**Help:**
- Terminal team: API questions
- LOIS team: Integration patterns

---

## Failsafe Plan

**Trigger:** End of Day 2 significantly behind

**Fallback:** Analysis rules + notification only (no LOIS trigger, no P&L tracking)

**Cut:**
- Paper trading performance tracking
- LOIS integration
- Multiple analysis types (just do one well)

**Keep:**
- Configurable analysis rules
- Real data, real analysis
- Demo that one rule works

---

## Wild Cards (Future Ideas)

- **User Intent Dashboard** - the other spark about understanding what users are trying to do
- Full production LOIS integration (real trades)
- Analysis marketplace (share rules)
- Backtesting against historical data
- AI-suggested rules based on user trading history

## Tech Notes

**Architecture:**
```
User Config -> Analysis Engine (code, not AI) -> Trigger System -> Mock LOIS
                     |
                     v
            Paper Trading Tracker -> P&L Dashboard
```

**Key Decisions:**
- Claude helps BUILD analysis logic, doesn't RUN analysis at query time
- Deterministic code execution = fast, reliable, no hallucination risk
- Mock LOIS for demo = safe, clear path to production
