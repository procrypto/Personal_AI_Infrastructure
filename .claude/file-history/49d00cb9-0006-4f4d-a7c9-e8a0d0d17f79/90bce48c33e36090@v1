# Milestone Context

**Generated:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** Ready for /gsd:new-milestone

## Features to Build

- **Fix watchlist token names**: Names showing blank/missing - need to display token symbols/names properly (PRIORITY)
- **Screener column alignment**: Align data elements vertically within token rows for structured table-like appearance, regardless of token name length
- **Fix Sell All button**: "Close All" button doesn't close positions - wire up the command properly
- **Fix P&L calculations**: P&L calculations showing incorrect values
- **Market cap display**: Show market cap instead of tiny prices that display as missing/zero
- **Rebrand to AAT**: Rename widget from "Autopilot" to "AAT Autonomous Anomaly Terminal"

## Scope

**Suggested name:** v1.5 AAT Fixes & Rebrand
**Estimated phases:** 4
**Focus:** Fix critical bugs (token names, Sell All, P&L), improve screener layout, rebrand to AAT

## Phase Mapping

- Phase 18: Watchlist token names fix + market cap display (data fixes)
- Phase 19: Screener column alignment (layout polish)
- Phase 20: Sell All button + P&L calculation fixes (controls & accuracy)
- Phase 21: AAT rebrand (naming update across widget)

## Constraints

- Watchlist token names is highest priority (user specified)
- No backend changes - all frontend fixes
- Keep existing widget structure, just fix issues

## Additional Context

User wants screener to look like structured columns of data even without visible column lines - elements should align vertically across rows regardless of token name length or content.

P&L calculations are off - need investigation to determine root cause.

Token prices sometimes missing because values are too small - show market cap as alternative metric.
