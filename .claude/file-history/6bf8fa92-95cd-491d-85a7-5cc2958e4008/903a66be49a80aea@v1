# Project Milestones: Token Analysis Autopilot

## v1.0 Signal Processor Architecture (Shipped: 2026-01-09)

**Delivered:** Pure signal processor architecture with LOIS-ready interfaces, sub-100ms latency, and gradual cutover capability.

**Phases completed:** 1-3 (9 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**
- WebSocket data feed handlers with DataFeedMessage types and in-memory storage
- Data validation and normalization layer with 62+ tests
- SignalProcessor with dual-path architecture (fast path for simple rules, OHLCV path for complex analysis)
- LOIS-ready interface types for future Rust reimplementation
- Performance validation proving sub-0.1ms latency (100x better than 100ms target)
- Signal pipeline integrated into CLI with `--new-engine` flag for gradual cutover

**Stats:**
- 43 TypeScript files
- 11,066 lines of TypeScript
- 3 phases, 9 plans, ~27 tasks
- 1 day from start to ship

**Git range:** `86ddb29` → `5f36936`

**What's next:** Production validation with real data, frontend integration to connect as WebSocket client
