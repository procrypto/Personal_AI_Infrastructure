# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 03-02
    provides: SignalProcessor with sub-100ms performance
  - phase: 02-03
    provides: createSignalPipeline integration helper
provides:
  - Signal pipeline wired into CLI run command
  - --new-engine flag for gradual cutover
  - Parallel mode for validation during transition
affects: [frontend, lois-integration]

# Phase 3 Plan 3: Final Cutover Summary

**Signal pipeline integrated into CLI with --new-engine flag enabling gradual cutover from polling to reactive signal processing**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 9 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-09T07:16:22Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-09T07:24:54Z
- **Tasks:** 2 auto + 1 checkpoint
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Signal pipeline wired into CLI run command with market data provider
- `--new-engine` flag enables switching between parallel and new-only modes
- Signal callback broadcasts rule signals via WebSocket
- Data feed handler routes incoming messages through SignalProcessor

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Integrate signal pipeline into CLI run command** - `c2190d7` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Add parallel mode flag for gradual cutover** - `063ebc7` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/cli.ts` - Added signal pipeline integration, --new-engine flag, mode indicators

## Decisions Made
- Parallel mode as default for safe validation during transition
- `--new-engine` flag enables new pipeline only when ready
- Old polling code preserved (not deleted) until validation complete

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
- Port 8765 conflict when frontend runs its own WebSocket server instance
- Resolution: Frontend needs to connect to backend's WebSocket instead of starting its own

## Next Phase Readiness
- Phase 3 COMPLETE - all plans finished
- Milestone complete - ready for production validation
- Frontend integration needed: connect to backend WebSocket instead of spawning own instance

## Frontend Integration Note

The frontend currently starts its own WebSocket server on port 8765, causing conflicts. The frontend should:
1. Remove its embedded WebSocket server startup
2. Connect as a client to the backend's WebSocket at ws://localhost:8765
3. Receive signals via the `signal` event type
