# Roadmap: TrenchBench API

## Overview

Transform local-api into a production-grade Cloud Run service with environment-aware configuration, containerization, and CI/CD pipelines following the ferris-the-sentinel deployment pattern.

## Domain Expertise

None

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3, 4): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

- [x] **Phase 1: Environment Configuration** - Multi-env config system (local/beta/prod)
- [x] **Phase 2: Containerization** - Dockerfile and Docker setup for Cloud Run
- [ ] **Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions for beta and prod deployments
- [ ] **Phase 4: GCP Integration** - Secret Manager, Workload Identity, deployment verification

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Environment Configuration
**Goal**: Environment-aware configuration that switches ClickHouse endpoints and settings based on local/beta/prod mode
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Research**: Unlikely (internal config patterns, existing env structure)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Environment detection and config loader
- [x] 01-02: ClickHouse endpoint switching per environment

### Phase 2: Containerization
**Goal**: Production-ready multi-stage Dockerfile optimized for Bun/TypeScript on Cloud Run
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Research**: Likely (Bun Docker patterns)
**Research topics**: Bun official Docker image, multi-stage build patterns for Bun/TS, .dockerignore best practices
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Multi-stage Dockerfile and .dockerignore
- [x] 02-02: Local Docker build/run verification

### Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline
**Goal**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated beta (main) and prod (v* tags) deployments
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Research**: Likely (ferris-the-sentinel pattern)
**Research topics**: Current ferris-the-sentinel workflows, GCP Artifact Registry authentication, Cloud Run deploy actions
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Beta deployment workflow (main branch)
- [ ] 03-02: Production deployment workflow (v* tags)
- [ ] 03-03: Workflow testing verification

### Phase 4: GCP Integration
**Goal**: Workload Identity Federation auth, Secret Manager for credentials, deployment verification
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Research**: Likely (GCP auth patterns)
**Research topics**: GCP Secret Manager access from Cloud Run, Workload Identity Federation setup, VPC egress configuration
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 04-01: Secret Manager and WIF configuration
- [ ] 04-02: End-to-end deployment verification
