# Phase 7: Route Cleanup - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-13
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A clean break from the legacy route structure. All routes lose the `/local-api/` prefix and adopt kebab-case naming. The `/labs/` prefix becomes `/custom/` to signal these are intentional production endpoints, not experimental features.

When this is done, the API should look like it was always designed this way. No traces of the old naming conventions, no backwards compatibility shims, no dual-route support. Clients update their calls to the new paths.

</vision>

<essential>
## What Must Be Nailed

- **Consistency** - Every route follows the same kebab-case pattern without legacy prefixes
- **Cleaner URLs** - Shorter, intuitive paths that make sense at first glance
- **Future-ready** - Routes that represent the production API going forward
- **Clean documentation** - Docs rewritten as if the old routes never existed

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Backwards compatibility - No redirects or aliases for old paths
- Route functionality changes - Only renaming, not changing what routes do
- Adding new endpoints - Strictly working with existing routes
- Deprecation warnings - Clean break, not gradual migration

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Standard kebab-case conversion: `wallet_tracker` → `wallet-tracker`
- Rename `/labs/` to `/custom/` - sounds intentional, not experimental
- Keep `/ext/` prefix for extensions (already meaningful)
- Documentation should be complete rewrite, not find-and-replace

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This is the final cleanup phase before the API is truly production-ready. The goal is consistency and professionalism in the URL structure.
