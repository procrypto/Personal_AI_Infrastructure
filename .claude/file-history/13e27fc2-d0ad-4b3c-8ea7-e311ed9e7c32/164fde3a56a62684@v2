# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-01-12)

**Core value:** Feature parity — all 37 UI features from dash-pauls must work in the unified architecture
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Intel Grid Features

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 7 (Intel Grid Features)
Plan: 1 of ? in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-13 — Completed 02-01-PLAN.md

Progress: ███░░░░░░░ 21%

**Phase 2 Progress:**

- 02-01-PLAN.md: Intel Grid validation ✓

**Ready for next Intel Grid plan or Phase 3**

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 11.3 min
- Total execution time: 0.57 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total  | Avg/Plan |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 1     | 2/2   | 15 min | 7.5 min  |
| 2     | 1/?   | 19 min | 19 min   |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (10 min), 01-02 (5 min), 02-01 (19 min)
- Trend: → (validation plans take longer due to code review)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- New branch (feat/trenchbench-unified) to preserve source branches for rollback
- Merge dash-pauls INTO preload-data (preload-data has cleaner architecture)
- Keep CustomEvents during merge for lower risk validation
- **[01-01]** Resolve all conflicts in single commit (git doesn't allow partial merge commits)
- **[01-01]** Keep trenchBenchStore from preload-data as primary data source
- **[01-01]** Token amount tracking for position exit detection (not SOL amounts)
- **[01-02]** TypeScript verification sufficient for merge (Tolgee i18n is external service)
- **[02-01]** Badge holdingPercent uses SOL amounts (functional; token amounts enhancement for future)

### Deferred Issues

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
