# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-01-12)

**Core value:** Feature parity — all 37 UI features from dash-pauls must work in the unified architecture
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Branch Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Branch Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress

**Phase 1 Plans:**
- 01-01-PLAN.md: Branch creation + Intel Grid conflict (3 tasks) ✓ COMPLETE
- 01-02-PLAN.md: Vantage + Anomalyzer conflicts + build verification (3 tasks)

**Note:** Plan 01-01 also resolved vantage + anomalyzer conflicts (git requires all conflicts resolved before commit). Plan 01-02 now only needs build verification.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- New branch (feat/trenchbench-unified) to preserve source branches for rollback
- Merge dash-pauls INTO preload-data (preload-data has cleaner architecture)
- Keep CustomEvents during merge for lower risk validation
- **[01-01]** Resolve all conflicts in single commit (git doesn't allow partial merge commits)
- **[01-01]** Keep trenchBenchStore from preload-data as primary data source
- **[01-01]** Token amount tracking for position exit detection (not SOL amounts)

### Deferred Issues

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
