## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Key decisions from all milestones:

- LOIS documentation is a cross-cutting quality gate for all phases
- Recommend lois-adapter.ts pattern for format conversions at WebSocket boundary
- Autopilot plugin checks directory existence before spawning
- Extract pure functions for testability (calculatePnL, parseAutopilotEvent)
- Adaptive interval refresh for useTimeAgo (balance responsiveness vs CPU)
- Performance section at top, Configuration at bottom (set-and-forget)
- Only Performance and Activity sections collapsible
- Hybrid architecture: NATS for display prices, CLI for signal generation
- Calculate totalPnlSol in frontend from position data (not CLI stats)
- Defer CLI NATS integration to future milestone (data pipeline optimization)

### Deferred Issues

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

### Roadmap Evolution

- v1.0 archived: Autopilot Frontend Integration (4 phases, 4 plans)
- v1.1 archived: Autopilot Unit Tests (1 phase, 1 plan)
