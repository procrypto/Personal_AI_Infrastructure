# Phase 2 Plan 3: Signal Integration Summary

**Signal pipeline wiring SignalProcessor to WebSocket data feeds with callback-based emission**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-09T06:29:45Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-09T06:31:32Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- createSignalPipeline() factory function integrating SignalProcessor with data feeds
- handleDataFeed() routing market_data_feed to processMarketData and ohlcv_update to processOHLCV
- onSignal() callback registration for real-time signal emission
- aggregateSignals() helper exposing engine aggregation

## Task Commits

Tasks were implemented together for coherent API:

1. **Task 1+2: Signal pipeline with emission** - `c804d80` (feat)
   - Both tasks combined: integration module + signal emission

**Plan metadata:** (this commit)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/signal/integration.ts` - Signal pipeline factory and routing
- `src/signal/index.ts` - Barrel export updates

## Decisions Made
- Combined Task 1 (integration) and Task 2 (emission) into single coherent module since they form one logical unit

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed as specified, with tasks combined for coherence.

## Issues Encountered
None

## Next Phase Readiness
- Phase 2 complete: dual-path engine operational
- Signal pipeline ready for wiring in CLI
- Ready for Phase 3: Interface Cleanup & Cutover
