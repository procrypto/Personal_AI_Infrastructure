{"display":"1. mix of everything is fair to say, although it's a startup environment so business process systems are not currently part of the \"problem\" landscape very often but that's not to say they'll never be part of the solution to any. i have repo access for everything and my own understanding as a power user, qa tester and marketer for the products we build for users. I'm working in product and growth so my often looking to make the inferences required to think about the problem from the perspective of what can i build with what we have now, and what might we be able to do in future if we do the first bit in ways that already serve to expand the whole. 3. i think both a mental model but a documented mental model, that's to say, one i can return to and re-prime myself (or agents) to recreate on demand. 4. I've been prompting agents manually for task specific knowledge. This can be quite time consuming but i use the discovery process both to build my mental model, and pre-prime the context for the agent/model i'm working with to help me plan the actual solutions from an informed place. I'm hunting for ways that things have been build which are already potentially elegant and efficient if i can continue to extend them as opposed to working in parallel on probably substandard alernative ways to do what's already been started by bonafide cracked engineers. 5. Understanding both what's been done, is in production etc and also what might be possible if we enhance their work with more features and functionality. This might be finding the most economical and appropriate data source to power what we want to create, or understanding how \"their bit\" would most like anything new to plug into it. The breakdown comes when the systems havent been fully understood in terms of what they can do for us or vice versa, what we can do to augment them. 5. It takes much too much time to do this repeatedly and so over time the ability to build a grand map of a system or process which points to all of the right fragments of context that agents might be able to use to build exactly the right picture they need at any given time seems very powerful. it would both help me understand and work on systems and processes, but also, help define exactly what type of documentation engineers, administrative works, anyone really, should be able to provide and to what level of detail, to be the most effective cog in this grander, ever improving machine.
