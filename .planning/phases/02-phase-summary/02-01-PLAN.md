<objective>
Define the PHASE-SUMMARY.md format and create the template for aggregating plan summaries into a single phase-level summary.

Purpose: Establish the format that will be used when a phase completes to document what was accomplished across all plans in that phase.
Output: templates/phase-summary.md template file with structure for aggregating plan summaries.

# Prior phase context (from frontmatter):
@.planning/phases/01-config-schema/01-01-SUMMARY.md

**Tech stack available:** None new (markdown templates)
**Established patterns:**
- summary.md template with frontmatter for dependency graph
- One-liner rules (substantive, not "phase complete")
- Frontmatter for machine-readable metadata

**Constraining decisions:**
- [Phase 1]: generate_phase_summary: true by default
- [Phase 1]: Phase summary aggregates plan summaries (not replaces)

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Design PHASE-SUMMARY.md structure</name>
  <files>None (design-only task)</files>
  <action>
Design the PHASE-SUMMARY.md format that aggregates plan summaries. Must include:

1. **Frontmatter** (for dependency graph):
   - phase, subsystem, tags (aggregated from plans)
   - provides (union of all plan provides)
   - affects (union of all plan affects)
   - tech-stack.added (union)
   - key-files (union)
   - key-decisions (aggregated)
   - patterns-established (aggregated)
   - Total duration, completed date

2. **Header section:**
   - Phase name and number
   - Substantive one-liner (what the phase shipped overall)
   - Total plans completed

3. **Performance section:**
   - Aggregated metrics (total duration, plan count)

4. **Plans Completed section:**
   - List each plan with its one-liner
   - Link to individual SUMMARY.md files

5. **Accomplishments section:**
   - Key outcomes across all plans (not exhaustive list)

6. **Decisions Made section:**
   - Aggregated key decisions from all plans

7. **Issues section:**
   - Count of issues created during this phase
   - Any blockers for next phase

8. **Next Phase Readiness section:**
   - What's ready for next phase
   - Any concerns

Design should NOT duplicate plan summaries — it aggregates and links.
  </action>
  <verify>Design documented in plan execution notes, ready for implementation in Task 2</verify>
  <done>PHASE-SUMMARY.md structure fully specified with all sections and aggregation rules</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create templates/phase-summary.md template</name>
  <files>~/.claude/get-shit-done/templates/phase-summary.md</files>
  <action>
Create the phase-summary.md template following the design from Task 1. Include:

1. File template with frontmatter structure
2. Markdown sections with placeholders
3. Aggregation guidance (how to combine plan data)
4. One-liner rules (phase-level substantive summary)
5. Guidelines section explaining when/how to use

Follow the same format as summary.md template:
- YAML frontmatter template
- Markdown body template in code block
- Guidance sections after template

Key difference from plan summary: Phase summary AGGREGATES, plan summary DOCUMENTS individual work.

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] templates/phase-summary.md exists
- [ ] Template includes frontmatter structure for dependency graph
- [ ] Template includes all required sections (header, performance, plans, accomplishments, decisions, issues, next phase)
- [ ] Template includes aggregation guidance
- [ ] Format is consistent with existing summary.md template

<success_criteria>

- PHASE-SUMMARY.md format fully designed
- templates/phase-summary.md template created
- Aggregation rules documented
- Ready for create-phase-summary.md workflow in Plan 02-02

After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-phase-summary/02-01-SUMMARY.md`:

# Phase 2 Plan 1: Phase Summary Format Summary

**[Substantive one-liner describing template created]**
