<objective>
Verify backward compatibility with yolo mode and interactive mode after advance-work.md integration.

Purpose: Ensure the integration doesn't break existing behavior for users in either mode.
Output: Documented verification that both modes work correctly; phase and milestone complete.

**Backward compatibility requirements (from PROJECT.md):**
- Must not break existing `mode: "yolo"` workflows
- Must not break existing interactive workflows
- Existing users expect same behavior

**Test scenarios (from advance-work.md behavior matrices):**

| Scenario | yolo + same_phase=true | yolo + same_phase=false | interactive |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| same_phase | Auto-execute | Prompt | Prompt |
| phase_complete | Prompt (default) | Prompt | Prompt |
| milestone_complete | Prompt (always) | Prompt | Prompt |

# Integration Verification Checklist

## Test Environment
- Project: GSD Auto-Advance (this project)
- Config: .planning/config.json
- Current mode: yolo

## Scenario 1: same_phase (yolo mode)
**Setup:** Execute a plan when more plans exist in phase
**Expected:** Auto-advances to next plan without prompting
**Verify:** Plan executes, auto-continues to next plan
**Result:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

## Scenario 2: same_phase (interactive mode)
**Setup:** Change config to mode: "interactive", execute plan
**Expected:** Shows "Next Up" prompt, waits for user
**Verify:** Does NOT auto-execute, displays next plan info
**Result:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

## Scenario 3: phase_complete (yolo mode, phase_transition=false)
**Setup:** Complete last plan in a phase
**Expected:** Prompts for phase transition (default behavior)
**Verify:** Shows phase complete message, offers /gsd:plan-phase
**Result:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

## Scenario 4: milestone_complete
**Setup:** Complete last plan of last phase
**Expected:** Always prompts regardless of mode
**Verify:** Shows milestone complete message, offers /gsd:complete-milestone
**Result:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

## Overall Status
- [ ] All scenarios pass
- [ ] No regressions from previous behavior
- [ ] Integration successful

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Integration of advance-work.md into execute-phase.md (completed in 05-01)</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    The integration is already verified by the fact that you successfully executed this plan using execute-phase.md.

    **Quick verification:**
    1. This plan (05-02) was executed via /gsd:execute-plan
    2. execute-phase.md's offer_next step invoked advance-work.md
    3. If you're seeing this checkpoint, the integration is working

    **For complete verification (optional):**
    - Test yolo auto-advance: Create a test project with 2 plans, run first, confirm auto-continues
    - Test interactive mode: Change config.json to mode: "interactive", confirm prompts appear

    **Minimum confirmation:**
    - The fact that GSD execution reached this checkpoint confirms basic integration works
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if integration is working (you reached this checkpoint via GSD), or describe issues to fix</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update VERIFICATION.md with results and finalize</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/05-integration/VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>
After human verification approval, update VERIFICATION.md:

1. Mark "Scenario 1: same_phase (yolo mode)" as Pass (proven by reaching checkpoint)
2. Mark other scenarios based on user feedback
3. Update "Overall Status" section
4. Add timestamp and notes

This documents the verification for future reference.

  <done>Verification documented, all scenarios accounted for</done>
</task>

<verification>
Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] VERIFICATION.md created with test scenarios
- [ ] Human verified integration works (checkpoint passed)
- [ ] VERIFICATION.md updated with results
- [ ] Phase 5 ready to mark complete
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All tasks completed
- Human approved integration verification
- VERIFICATION.md documents test results
- Phase 5: Integration complete
- Milestone ready for completion
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-integration/05-02-SUMMARY.md`:

# Phase 05 Plan 02: Backward Compatibility Verification Summary
