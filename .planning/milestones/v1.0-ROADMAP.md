# Milestone v1.0: GSD Auto-Advance MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-15
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 8

## Overview

Enhance GSD to automatically advance between plans within a phase, generate phase summaries on completion, and provide manual advancement control. Preserves phase transition decision points while eliminating friction within phases.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Config Schema

**Goal**: Add auto_advance configuration section to config.json template
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Add auto_advance schema to templates/config.json

**Details:**
- Designed auto_advance schema with three settings (same_phase, phase_transition, generate_phase_summary)
- Added to templates/config.json with smart defaults
- Documented behavior matrix for mode x settings combinations

### Phase 2: Phase Summary

**Goal**: Create workflow to aggregate plan summaries into PHASE-SUMMARY.md
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Define PHASE-SUMMARY.md format and aggregation logic
- [x] 02-02: Create create-phase-summary.md workflow

**Details:**
- Created template with comprehensive aggregation rules
- 7-step workflow with integration hooks for advance-work.md
- Error handling differentiates missing files vs disabled config

### Phase 3: Advance Logic

**Goal**: Core auto-advance orchestration handling all advancement scenarios
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Create advance-work.md workflow structure
- [x] 03-02: Implement same-phase, phase-transition, and milestone-complete logic

**Details:**
- Three handler steps with mode-aware behavior matrices
- Config-driven defaults with explicit override
- Safety rail: milestone_complete ALWAYS prompts regardless of settings

### Phase 4: Command Interface

**Goal**: /gsd:advance command for manual advancement triggering
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Create advance.md command in Commands/gsd/

**Details:**
- Command implements workflow directly rather than invoking external file
- Same YAML frontmatter pattern as progress.md and execute-plan.md

### Phase 5: Integration

**Goal**: Hook auto-advance into execute-phase.md and ensure backward compatibility
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Modify execute-phase.md offer_next step to invoke advance-work.md
- [x] 05-02: Test backward compatibility with yolo mode and interactive mode

**Details:**
- Replaced ~145 lines of inline scenario handling with ~30 line delegation
- All 4 test scenarios verified passing: yolo same_phase, interactive prompting, phase_complete prompting, milestone_complete safety rail

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- same_phase: true by default — auto-advance within phase eliminates friction
- phase_transition: false by default — prompt at boundaries preserves decision points
- milestone_complete: ALWAYS prompts — safety rail, never automated
- Centralized advance-work.md — single source of truth for both manual and automatic triggers

**Issues Resolved:**

- None — clean execution throughout

**Issues Deferred:**

- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None
